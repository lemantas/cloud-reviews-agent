Fluffy Cookie,PL,"Sep 4, 2025",5,I have never had any problems with…,"I have never had any problems with Scaleway. This has been the case for a long time. Although I only use Object Storage, the service is reliable. It works as it should. The data is simply there, and I have never encountered any problems retrieving it. And most importantly... Scaleway is not affiliated with the US."
Rafael,LT,"Aug 30, 2025",1,"On going server that I've been paying for years suddenly went ""our of stock""","So I've been paying for their server and one day I just needed to reinstall my OS but I was not able to do that. I contacted support and they send me a message that server all of the sudden is ""out of stock"" but I have paid for it and never stopped paying. Then they told me to order another server which is crazy. I simply cannot understand how the server that you paid for and never stopped paying goes ""out of stock""."

Ram,FR,"Aug 19, 2025",1,Failures of servers and lost data,"I've been a loyal client of Scaleway for 10+ years at the times when they were Online.net. And they were good. But since they became Scaleway year by year they get worse and worse. I'm administrator of several dediboxes (dedicated servers) for my clients. I've seen lots of unprofessional things: one of my servers stopped working because their IT guy accidentally powered off our server thinking it was the one that was requested for technical maintenance. We had an issue when the payment was not accepted for the first time, then we fixed the payment method and asked the support to confirm that. They confirmed everything is OK and the payment was made. But then they deleted our server and all backups (at their additional FTP space) because ""we didn't pay in time for the services"". And after 2 months of communication they did not had courage to say that it was their mistake or that they provided a wrong consulting regarding the payment information. But all the communication we had were in written form in the ticketing system so it was easy for them to read and analyze our communication, But it seems they have zero quality service department. In the last 3 years I had 4 servers destroyed. They just break down without any prior warnings. We have Zabbix monitoring configured with temperature, S.M.A.R.T. and other stats, but that does not help to predict a servers' failure. And the support says that the servers are not repairable. So you have only option to buy a new dedibox and restore your backups if you made them. At the recent hardware failure the support told me that all starting lines of their servers have very old hardware that can break at any minute and they say to use a higher end servers. Surprisingly they never mention that when you put an order for the starting lines of their servers. They don't inform you that this is a very old hardware that has very high risks of failure, unrepairable, and the user should take the risks. No, they don't do that. They simply want your money and fool you around. Of course in all these situations the support was very unhelpful. Maximum what the offered is a refund for the active month for the server in question. They were super unhelpful and their style of communication sounds like ""it's your problem, man, not ours, stop bothering us!"". In the past I recommended this company, but now it's a total disaster. Never ever deal with it."
Ihtsham Asmat,DE,"Aug 6, 2025",1,scammy hostile company,"Scathing Review of Scaleway: Dishonest Billing & Terrible Support I signed up for a free trial with Scaleway, hoping to test their cloud services. However, when I decided not to continue, I was shocked to find no clear cancellation option—instead, I had to manually delete all resources to avoid charges. Despite taking precautions, I was unexpectedly charged €139 for the first month. When I contacted support for a refund, their response was unbelievably cold and dismissive. They refused to refund me, even though: - Their cancellation process is misleading (no direct ""cancel subscription"" button). - Many other cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode) offer refunds in goodwill cases. - Their support agent rudely insisted they’d keep charging me for the next month, even after I explicitly wanted to cancel. Final Verdict: Avoid Scaleway at All Costs This company has: ❌ Deceptive billing practices (hidden charges, unclear cancellation). ❌ Terrible customer support (zero empathy, refusal to help). ❌ No respect for customers (many others report similar issues). If you value transparency, fairness, and decent support, stay far away from Scaleway. There are far better alternatives (Hetzner, AWS, DigitalOcean) that actually treat customers with respect. Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5) – A scammy, customer-hostile company."
Ols D,NO,"Jul 2, 2025",1,"Bad service, constantly goes down","When we learn IT, the first thing we learn is to have offsite backups for services and databases. This is something ScaleWay completely fails at. A few times this year we've lost access to our K8 services (we host multiple clients). Yesterday one of our clients had a major event. All our services were down because of ScaleWay. There had no empathy in the situation. They cannot do simple IT, do not trust them. They cannot do simple offsite services and backups."

Ebloz,ES,"Jan 14, 2025",1,Frustrating experience,"With Scaleway, everything becomes a frustrating experience. Yes, they are about the cheapest hosting provider you will find in Europe, but you get what you pay for. Here's an excerpt of the miserable state that Scaleway is in: 1. Impossible to run an email service on their servers. Most of their IPs have a really bad standing with a lot of the email blacklists. Therefore emails sent from a Scaleway host will bounce for a lot of destinations. They simply don't care to work with these blacklists in order to have a clean standing. 2. They won't let you downgrade a business account to a personal one. E.g. if you shut down your company and become a freelancer. A simple thing to do on about any website. Not with Scaleway. Their solution: delete your business account and create a new personal account. Of course that means that you have to order all services again and set them up from scratch. 3. Most frustrating support experience. They tell you that department X will appoach you about an issue. After a week of waiting you point out that you haven't been contacted, to which they respond that they will not approach you after all. They don't respect your time. Pay a bit more and get a reputable provider."
Aaron,GB,"Jan 10, 2025",1,Don’t purchase!,"Don’t purchase! Scaleway’s object storage with 'Edge Pipelines' doesn’t automatically disable the pipeline when you delete the bucket. If you spin up a bucket, attach an edge pipeline for accelerated egress, and later delete the bucket, you’d reasonably expect the associated pipeline to be removed. Not with Scaleway! Instead, they keep the pipeline active (and bill you for it), without any clear notice. To make matters worse, you’ll need to dig through their billing system just to figure out where the charges are coming from. And here’s the kicker—you can’t stop the pipeline without having the original bucket. So, you’re forced to recreate the bucket just to remove the pipeline! When I raised this with support, I was told that it’s somehow my responsibility to know this. This behavior is inconsistent with other parts of their service, where they don’t let you delete the parent resource without first deleting all dependent components. From this point, I would completely steer clear of these either idiotic or predatory schemes."

Steve Sparks,US,"Dec 20, 2024",1,Scaleway is a complete awful,"Scaleway is a complete awful. They trap you with hidden billing policies that they deliberately don’t disclose where they should on the service creation page. Instead, they bury critical details in some obscure subdomain documentation, expecting you to hunt for it. I accepted their 24-hour minimum rule, but then I discovered they bill for the entire month unless you jump through hoops to delete the service. Who runs a business like this? Dishonest companies, that’s who. When I contacted support, I was met with canned responses and zero effort to actually address my concerns. It’s like they employ NPCs instead of actual humans. They either can’t read or deliberately ignore customer messages. Avoid Scaleway at all costs unless you want to be scammed and disrespected. This company doesn’t care about customers just your money."

I´ve opened a ticket regarding this issue and ask why does my server don´t have lastest builds. Some agent awnsered saying that servers aren´t ""compatible"" :D, how funny is this awnser when nextly said ""please upgrade your server"", they offer a server with old OS and force you upgrade the server so you can use lastest OS (i assume you can use them). Theres no coerence when you provide windows server 2022 and say the server isn't compatible, so in low cost servers you will be vunerable, keep this in mind before order.

If you would try to revert the money via chargeback the will chase you via collector agency and then court. Do NOT ever use this awful service.

Othmane,FR,"Updated Jun 6, 2024",5,Amazing Postgres Managed Database Offering,"I'm leaving this review literally a few minutes after signing up to Scaleway. I have been benchmarking dozens of Postgres managed database providers and I can confidently say Scaleway comes on top. The UI/UX is really great, the dashboard easy to navigate and the configurability is perfect with various options. The onboarding experience was among the best if not the best I have had as a non-technical user. The pricing is greatin that it gradually scales and makes it affordable to help with early projects. It's transparent, and it's great that it also gives various speed/capacity options for storage separately from compute. I just wish it truly scaled to zero during times of inactivity, which would have allowed it to be truly billed by the minute for example - it's not the case with Scaleway, you provision an instance and it runs 24/7 which means you pay for it at all times. Performance-wise, I tested one of the smallest instances (DB-PLAY2-PICO at 1vCPU, 2GB RAM) and it was blazing-fast when compared to other managed database providers with a similar capacity. I rarely put reviews online but given the reviews I saw here and the amazing experience I've had so far I am doing so and encouraging everyone to give Scaleway a try. Great job to their product & engineering teams and I look forward to the rest of my experience using their services."

Someone,MT,"Mar 27, 2024",1,Hidden Costs and Indifferent Customer Service at Scaleway,"Be cautious of hidden costs with Scaleway. Their billing practices obscure transparency, making it challenging to track expenses due to some chargeable services not being visible in the user dashboard. Additionally, certain services are sometimes billed monthly, contrary to their advertised daily or lesser frequency. It is advisable to confirm any pricing with the helpdesk before utilizing services. My primary concern revolves around the lack of honesty and clarity in Scaleway's billing. Unexpected fees appeared on my bill without any prior indication or listing, casting doubt on the trustworthiness of [Provider Name]. This opacity, combined with a customer service team that appears indifferent to customer grievances, significantly erodes confidence in their services. If you're considering Scaleway, it is crucial to diligently monitor your bill for unforeseen charges and be prepared for a customer service experience that may fall short of providing adequate support and resolution."

Andrey Panin,KG,"Updated Feb 13, 2024",1,They took my personal data hostage,"tl;dr: Think twice about what you share with Scaleway. Use a throwaway dedicated virtual card to pay for their services. Never tie your physical debit or credit card to your account. I had a very bad experience with Scaleway. After signing up my account was immediately locked. That fact was understandable and not the main issue. But the real problem began when I tried to irrevocably delete my account. Turns out, that was not possible until I verify it - which I didn't want to do for a couple of reasons. Technical support played dumb and openly lied to me. Writing to the dedicated e-mail address for privacy topics had the same effect as speaking with the tech support. I wrote to their data protection officer (DPO) and never got a response. Basically, I felt absolutely helpless not being able to exercise my right under GDPR and have my personal data removed from their system. As of today, a month after last communication with their privacy person (who never introduced himself, so I had no idea who I was talking to), I don't know whether my account has been irrevocably deleted as they promised. Obviously, my recommendation for anyone is to stay away from this abomination of a company as possible. They are cowards."

cbo,CH,"Jan 9, 2024",1,Beware of Scaleway - Shady Practices and Unethical Business Conduct,"I wish I could give Scaleway a lower rating than one star, as my experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. I feel compelled to share my story to warn others about the dubious practices of this company. I initially signed up with Scaleway because of their seemingly competitive prices and promising services. However, my perception quickly changed when I discovered their tendency to make significant changes to their terms and conditions without obtaining customer consent. The most alarming incident occurred when they silently modified their terms and conditions, resulting in unexpected charges to my account. To add insult to injury, they chose to notify customers of these changes through a newsletter with an unrelated subject. This sneaky tactic left many users, including myself, blindsided and frustrated. The lack of transparency and communication from Scaleway is appalling. As a customer, I believe I have the right to be informed about any alterations to the terms and conditions that may impact my account and finances. It is downright unethical for a company to make such changes without explicit consent and then hide behind obscure newsletters to announce them. Furthermore, their customer support is unhelpful and dismissive, refusing to take responsibility for their actions. Instead of addressing the concerns of their users, Scaleway seems more interested in squeezing additional funds out of unsuspecting customers. I strongly advise anyone considering Scaleway as a service provider to think twice. There are numerous reputable alternatives in the market that prioritize honesty, transparency, and customer satisfaction. Scaleway's underhanded tactics and lack of integrity make them a company to avoid at all costs. Your hard-earned money and peace of mind deserve better than what Scaleway has to offer."

STARasGAMES,PL,"Updated Jun 19, 2023",5,Apple silicon - does the job for a great price.,"Review is specifically about renting M1 mac, can't say anything about other services. Pros: - cheap - good speed - friendly support team Cons: - tricky to get started if you are not a DevOps I needed a MacOS device to test something quickly about my work. That's why I decided to rent it online cuz I need it only for a few hours. Found Scaleway, and got interested in quite cheap prices, currently it's smth like $0.11 per hour to rent M1 Mac. At first, I was very suspicious about Scaleway, after reading all the 1-star reviews here on Trustpilot. But I didn't want to pay +$60 using other companies, so I took a risk. I have never rented a remote PC before, so the setup steps with the VNC client, encryption, etc were painful not gonna lie. Spent about an hour just to see Mac login screen. Documentation was a great help. Then my experience was ruined by using VNCViewer, it's super laggy, ping about 2-5 seconds. At first, I thought it was Scaleway's fault, but after a few hours of pain I decided to try TeamViewer instead and oh boi, this was on another level. No lags no issues, it was almost instant. I also checked the speed from Mac to my current location using Speedtest and it was the maximum possible value that their speedo could show lol. Also, I created a support ticket. I wanted to pay my bills and forget cuz I don't need Mac anymore. Despite I didn't receive an instant reply, the support team is quite friendly and competent, I'm happy with that. Made an account on Trustpilot just to write down this review."

Jakob Maaløe,DK,"Jun 14, 2023",1,"No access to server, support not helpful","We needed a bare metal mac M1 to build a reactnative app and scaleway looked like a decent provider with reasonable pricing. Signup process was a hazzle. I tried to register as a company but was not allowed to do so since our email address was not professional enough. We use a gmail address in our starup. Started a private account just to get going. Entered a valid credit card but the signup process got stuck and I could not enter the same card since it was already registered. Tried to login by email, entered a CHAPTA challenge, entered som more CHAPTA, etc. and I finally got access by a magic link. I created a support case to help them improve. Was greated by a chat robot, got redirected to a human that never appeared. Created another support case and a friendly human apologized. No worries! It is just signup and signin they have trouble with. How about their service? Worst service ever! We somehow crashed our server and could not get access to it. Tried to reinstall it. Waited 10 hours but still no access. Created a support case and was asked to... reinstall the server since he could not see anything. Reinstalled again, wasted a day. Talked to some other supporter who would contact the developer team. They never returned. After some back and forth I escalated to a manager. About a week after we could not get access and no usable replies from support I closed our account. We did considder to just buy another mac from them but I really wanted to help them improve and look into why their server crashed. But no response from their developers after 6 days. No post mortem. We tried to buy another mac server but none was available. Some supporters were incompetent, some were friendly, but no one got our server back up and running. Wasted around $100 and more important a lot of time."

Ivan,UA,"May 9, 2023",1,Stay away from that company,"Firstly, I was unable to use the service as intended, which was frustrating. Despite my attempts to use the service, I encountered various technical difficulties that made it impossible to use. Secondly, when I tried to seek help with these issues, I found that there was no help available. The customer service was helpless, and I was unable to get any support or assistance in resolving the issues I faced. Thirdly, I was concerned about the inability to remove my CREDIT CARD details from their platform. This is a serious issue as it poses a risk to my personal and financial security. Lastly, the registration process was misleading, as it advertised charging money per hour, but in reality, the charges were levied for a minimum of 24 hours, regardless of usage. This is dishonest and lacks transparency, which undermines the trust that customers have in the company. Overall, based on my experience, I cannot recommend using the services of this company. The issues I faced, including technical difficulties, poor customer service, security concerns, and a lack of transparency, suggest that there are significant problems with their services that need to be addressed."

But nowadays their prices are not competitive any more while all the issues remained! Their VM instances (especially the cheaper DEV machines) are so insanely slow, but they're priced at similar prices as premium providers. A 4GB machine gives you 3.5GB usable ram, which is unacceptable that 0.5GB is lost due to ""VM overhead"" (No other provider lets you take this hit!). Their S3 offering is somewhat ok but absolutely not compliant, multipart uploads do NOT work unless your tooling understands their weird process for handling these. I would absolutely stay away from scaleway nowadays, unfortunate what happened to them."

Never have I ever been asked for such information from Amazon, Google, Heroku, Azure etc. I was just using the M1 with Xcode and they mentioned that my account was locked due to a ""potential security issue"" and an ""an inconsistency in your account details"", therefore ""for security reasons we need to identify you as the owner of the personal and banking data you have saved on this account"". I asked them to kindly further explain the inconsistency that they found and they refused ""Due to internal security and privacy reasons, we cannot share the detailed information that lead to this decision"". Absolutely outrageous, they expect the customer to send them personal information (ID, selfie, address), and they refuse to explain why. I think they just want you to have a taste of their services and then just lock you out of your account until you provide your data, because I've seen lots of users complaining about this.

Anthony,US,"May 27, 2022",1,Requires way too much information for cheap VMs,"I signed up for this site as I needed a virtual Mac OS for a development course, and their rates were pretty good. After I signed up, I was greeted by a notice about ""quotas"" - the more that you verify about yourself, the more you would have access to. That's fair, so I provided and verified my credit card, and decided to not do the ""optional - upload your state-issued identification"" step, because that was just too far outside my comfort zone. I then saw I couldn't create any VMs because my ""quotas"" were too low. I spoke with customer support and as it turns out, uploading state-issued identification is NOT optional, and all accounts are expected to do it to rent ANY virtual machine - even those that are only 0.10 Euro per hour. I don't appreciate that I was lied to about this being optional. If I knew from the get-go, I wouldn't have provided and verified my credit card. There are no options to remove my payment method, so I now have to rely on support to do that for me. Don't waste your time. Sign up for a different site.

They asked me to do things which were not possible in their UI, repeated these questions multiple times and at one point changed their language from English to French. While they were quick to reply, their replies were not helpful. I didn't feel like they were trying to help me, as much as try to meet some internal quota for ticket reply time. I was promised a reply from their ""expert team"", but I never got one. Eventually I resolved the issue myself. It is still unfortunate the only two payment methods are either credit card or SEPA.

F.,BE,"Dec 15, 2021",4,"Good enough, with a few caveats","I'm kinder on Scaleway than I'd be on a provider such as GCP, because they are much smaller and trying to do things differently. Yes, the UI isn't the best, they're still coming up with new products, etc. But hey, it's a business trying to position itself as more ethical than most! And so far the experience has been pleasant: we've relied on their customer support twice (plus a few uses of their Slack) and our issues were solved. The specific negatives I've experienced are: - Private networks are per-location, but some other components are per-region. So we can't protect Object Storage by locating it inside a VPC. I guess that makes sense, but it's not ideal. - Managed databases couldn't be part of a private network. They actually changed this recently, but by that point I had given up on private networks altogether. - Instance-to-instance traffic in private networks could be much better. Some providers go beyond gigabit speeds. - Object storage stopped working for a few days due to a change in the signing algorithm, but we weren't notified. The team mitigated the issue after a week or so, but I would've liked to know that it might be coming. I ended up upgrading to S3's v4 signing algorithm to solve the problem on our end. - IPs can't be assigned between objects of different types. This is a reasonable shortcoming, but it meant I couldn't simply point a Public Gateway's IP to an instance, and had to update DNS as well. - DHCP resolution in private networks was a bit spotty and/or the issue was with automatic mappings. I ended using manual NAT and mapping things myself. - I still haven't managed to deploy their Docker-based automatic containers. The resources of the container are too limited to successfully deploy our Python containers. On the other hand, there's some nice positives: - Pricing is competitive. - The managed database has been flawless so far. Automated backups and failover nodes are nice and not as expensive as competitor's. - SSH performance is pretty good. I've used other providers where SSH is almost unusable as characters only show up after 1 second or more. - Migrating out of a private network was simple enough, as the instances acquired public IPs immediately and I was able to update DNS in real-time. So all in all, we're happy with them. That said, we are considering some of their competitors that share a similar stance (EU-based, ethical, renewable energy), because then we'd be able to finally centralize our entire infrastructure."
Thjis Maat,AT,"Dec 8, 2021",4,Scaleway is different from many similar…,"Scaleway is different from many similar providers, but I let you judge based on the rest of my review. I've been using their service for a few years now and I'm mostly happy. Fair amount of locations that is slowly growing, currently 5, affordable servers, tolerant as in obviously a smaller company than the big players, so when something happens it's relatively easy and fast to solve. Their object storage is a great alternative to aws s3, disk management on servers is easy, always hourly billing and reasonable plan sizes. Now to the negative, for the cheaper plans at least it doesn't seem to be much fail over, I once had a complete server crash on on of their ARM64 servers (no longer available it seems) and basically lost it, support where fast to inform me about it. Luckily with proper backup I was able to recreate it fast and it's cheap so it wasn't a big deal. Another negative aspect is the IPv6 implementation, which seems to be DHCP, that means, for every reboot of your server, you might get a new IPv6 address. IPv4 is tied to the server tho and multiple addresses are supported. Just thought it's an odd configuration choice. I recommend Scaleway if you look for something cheap, knows what you're doing and have proper backup so that you could restore quickly if anything goes wrong."

So i removed everything which create costs on my scaleway account. Beside the snapshots. Of course they couldnt tell me why i was billed for this. You can read the scaleway Ticket which i uploaded in this message. Not only arnt they able to tell you what you ran, they also try to make you a fool by presenting odd answers like, ""do you know that youre not paiing for the storage occupied on one volume, but the whole used volume ?"" It would be hallirious if not sad. In the screenshots you can see that my Local SSD costs are increasing beside not having any ordered / active. I know that its not much money (Beside the 16.20€ i paid in January, what would mean that i used 550GB local SSD storage for one month. Which is extraordinary minding that i only created 3 Development instances using 180GB space. Also you can see that the big instances where created on 11.Jan. If you have a scaleway account, please check you local SSD and Network Billing I have uploaded the proof that no volumes were active, beside 2*80GB + 1*20GB snapshots, which are billed separately and cost 0,03€ during the time (8hours) of this chat / event.

Josh Jameson,IE,"Updated Nov 10, 2020",1,As cheap as chips but absolutly crap control panel.,"As cheap as chips but absolutely crap control panel. For over two years I used them for backups and mail server hosting. I had a few other servers with them that were used as web apps. GOOD: - Fast network for the price - DDOS was never an issue BAD: - It takes over 5 mins to STOP a VM? - Price hike in 2020. - They discontinued all their value servers, which is how they got popular. Now they want $$$ for a service which is quite frankly garbage. - Shutting down a server during low stock periods to do something like add a disk, means you won't be able to start the server again. This is because they immediately sell the server slot to someone else during the 10 mins it takes to stop and start the server from their awful control panel. - Restoring backups and snapshots is almost impossible. If you can manage to create a server that is in stock it will boot from the backup disk instead of the system drive. Support can't speak english so it's impossible to explain. - They have ""human bots"" on support to give the appearance of quick ticket responses, but any meaningful Support reply will be 24 hours++. Usually waiting that long is because their control panel is glitched. - During the 2years+ with scaleway I had a single abuse complaint on a Thursday evening. They gave 48 hours, disabling the server during the weekend. It took them 36 hours to respond to ticket to unlock the server. So they demand a single individual 48 hours during his time off work, but a whole company can't be bothered to reply for 36 hours. LOL. I couldn't even create a backup or snapshot while that server was in the locked state. They held my data hostage for a production website. Scaleway: I'm done. Price hike your way into irrelevancy for all I care. I tried to like your service because of the attractive price. With an expensive price... why am I using you? You are not production ready."

They said that they had indicated in the first message that they noticed an inconsistency in my account details (but actually they did not indicate such information in the first message). From that point I've got trust issues with this ""Trust & Safety team"". 3) There is an option to ""report to a manager"". I thought that would be necessary to involve a manager for clarifications. I sent my complaint about their questionable message that I had reasons to consider a scam. 4) Three days later I received a clear attempt to intimidate: ""We kindly remind you that any services on your account will be removed and deleted within 24 hours if we do not receive the required information from you"". ""As indicated in the previous ticket ,your account, as well as all related services, have been temporarily locked for security reasons"" - that's such a lie. I don't know what do they mean by the ""as indicated in the previous ticket"" because never have I been warned that my account was going to get limited and deleted soon after. The list of requirements has grown: still an ID card or two sides of a passport, a phone number, a login and the ticket number. 5) I haven't received anything from a manager I reported to whom. Basically... you can't treat your new customers as random scammers, demand sensitive personal info with such urgency, ignore your customers, explain nothing, say ""as we indicated"" when you didn't indicate anything and be inconsistent or you'll be bad and not trustworthy.

Dennis Rech,DE,"Jan 29, 2019",2,Not as good as expected,"I ran several servers over the past few years at scaleway. Unfortunately I came across many thing which made me kind of disappointed: - System has often problems while booting from boot script - No Quota possible of root fs (nbd) - After upgrade to a newer dist, kernel modules are broken and cannot be fixed (iptables etc. not working, support does not provide help) - Switching off and on can take HOURS due to archiving of nbd disks - complicated billing: if you run a resource a specific amount of time, the billing stops normally at the ""upper limit"". But if you experience hardware problems and have to shut off your system and reboot it, you will get a different hardware which is considered as new resource and the billing starts from the beginning and is not ""capped"" anymore. So the price is ok but all the issues I had made me choose a different hosting provider."
Sven Neumann,DE,"Jan 25, 2019",1,Stay away from Scaleway,"Stay away from Scaleway, at all costs. They praise themselves as disruptive, and this is absolutely true, but in the worst way possible, more like destructive, because they will destroy you and your service if you trust in them. Their support is not answer / helping , instead they just answer with default prewritten answers. Their network is overloaded most of the time, which leads to very very poor network performance on your server (sometimes less than 10mbit/s in up and download) Their technology seems to be some sort of rejected hardware / throw outs, which nobody else wanted to have. They crash almost everyday. Additionally the software they use is super buggy, the online console is not working, servers wont turn on for days, mounted drives are dismounted and cannot be remounted and several other issues. In conclusions, do not consider using scaleway at any cost, they appear to be super cheap, but what's it worth when your service is not reliable? Don't go there."

Onder OZCAN,GB,"Oct 10, 2018",1,Scaleway could be seen as cheap and…,"Scaleway could be seen as cheap and competitive but when you are starting to use their services, you can understand how they treat to the customers like a useless and gives 0 support when something gets serious. They recently suspended my droplet regarding billing payment failure (Which charged 8 days ago and I don't have any overdue payment) during the busy hour. When I opened the ticket to customer support, they replied me that It could happen when the new invoice is creating as a draft. And I was pretty sure, they have a system failure and that's why they locked my server during the busy hour but they never accept any mistake which has done from their side. Because I don't feel safe on Scaleway anymore, I am switching to Amazon today."
Byron Branfield,GB,"Oct 3, 2018",1,"Unauthorised charges, AVOID","So I signed up with these people to test out their platform, I ended up going with another solution. I had fired up an instance and then after testing and realizing it was not a good fit, I shut down all services. I then noticed that my card was being charged from Scaleway, I double checked no services were running. On contacting support, I was informed that I had an active IP address and that was the result of the billing, I have also checked the back end and there is no way to turn it off or unassign or anything. It is outright theft, really. I would AVOID at all costs and if you do try them, delete your account after you realize they suck."
Adrian “aidyMatic!” Porter,GB,"Aug 22, 2018",4,This company seems to get bad press,"This company seems to get bad press, they offer virtual servers quite cheaply. The servers can work well and my initial server at £2.99 a month has run faultless for a year. I'm setting up another site that needs lots of room, as the faq is a little sparse I had to buy a bigger server. Setup was flawless, I do have a slight problem with email but it's working as expected. I really like it. Basically I have written to OS Setup instructions in a note pad, and backed up the actual site to my pc. So if it goes down I can setup a replacement in under 30 minutes!"

Ian,GB,"Aug 14, 2018",1,False hopes!,Their system allowed me to create a server with addons that don't even work with it. Without these addons the server was no use to me. Upon questioning this they came up with an excuse and no apology. I asked to close my account as it was miss-sold to me and they can't because there is an outstanding invoice. How much is that invoice for? 6p They aren't even willing to save some face over the sum of 6p. Says everything you need to know about a company!

Gunther Schadow,BR,"Jul 20, 2018",1,"Cool technology HORRIBLY executed, RUN AWAY!","I have been with Scaleway for a few years. Initially I was lured by what seemed like really cool technology and low pricing for large amount of SSD storage. That was good. Unfortunately this company is an example how great technology can be so incredibly badly executed that the entire company is useless and will probably be run into oblivion soon. I have stuck around with them for too long, because I was so charmed by their technology. So my last words here on them really mean something. There are 3 deal breaker problems. 1. You can ABSOLUTELY NOT run a production system on them, because if you need to reboot, you will be out for hours, in which time your data will be backed up over the network and your physical machine released. Then to get back online, the same process runs in reverse. This can take many hours. IMPOSSIBLE to run anything critical under such conditions. 1.b. The initial boot process is flaky, as the disk units might not be ready in time for booting, so you might have to re-boot several times to get your disk volumes online. 2. Service is horrible. I was stuck for months with some silly outbound firewall blocking egress connections. Many times rebooting (see above) and totally inadequate service to try to resolve it. For the most time I paid this service and was unable to actually use it. Well, I thought at least I had one extra place where I had a backup of massive amount of critical data ... well until ... 3. In the last 3 months I had a billing problem with my credit card that had been re-issued but I did not physically have it to be able to update it. Still only in June I got an email from them, warning me of a charging problem that very first time in June 2018. They threatened that if I would not resolve this in seven (7) days, they would delete all my data. And that is what they did. 3.b. when I came back with the credit card update in July, I paid my back invoices, only to find out that indeed my data was gone. If I had known they had deleted my data, I would not have paid. This is ridiculous. So you can see, Scaleway is a technically cool idea, executed so impossibly bad that the only way for them to go is into the dustbin of history. Very sad for the technology. For the company, I am so angry with them that I am not sad at all."
JJ,GB,"Updated Nov 3, 2018",1,A reboot lost me access to all my data. (twice cause I am a glutton for punishment),"--- Updated 02/11/2018 Just keeps getting better..... today I get the following two emails, notice the times: 16.20 - ""Scaleway account locked due to suspicious activity"" 17.00 - ""Suspension of service"" The second email was because I'd not replied to the first. I panic. Must be serious if they are suspending my account for taking 40mins to respond to their email. I start emailing them - has my account been hacked? Nope..... it's a billing issue. Yup. I ran out of a meeting to deal with this and it's a billing issue. Seems we still owe money following shutting down our last server and leaving them. See the below for the tale of woe that led up to this. Honestly, I can't describe just how amateurish this company is. --- Updated - 25/09/2018 -- Had to reboot again... guess what.... PXE-E32: TFTP open timeout PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel Boot Agent. Yup... server wouldn't reboot. Honestly you can't make this up. 200+ Gb of test data, again held hostage. Down for 12 hours before eventually it managed to boot - all the time me sitting there clicking on ""Reboot""... waiting.... failed.... try again. To add insult in injury we've been overcharged by 54% for months (we never noticed) and frankly support are directly answering our questions about certain 'addtional' items on our bill. Not fit for purpose - avoid at all costs. ---- Original ---- A reboot lost me access to all my data. To upgrade the space on your server you need to shutdown, add more storage and restart. Unfortunately when you shutdown, Scaleway backs up all your storage to the 'cloud' and then releases the hardware you are running on. The backup takes an hour, during which, if Scaleway is short on servers they release your hardware to the next customer. By the time your backup is complete, you add the new storage and restart there might be no hardware available to assign to your server. And well, then you're basically stuffed. You cannot restart your server until Scaleway make more hardware available or some other customer is unfortunate enough to reboot and you 'steal' their hardware. But, unbelievably, this is by design. So much so they made an FAQ!!!! (unfortunately Trustpilot don't allow links, but go and search for ""Why is my server not starting?""!) So now, according to their 'support' I just need to wait until hardware is available to get access back to my data. The fact that they can think this is even remotely acceptable solution tells you all you need to know about Scaleway. Do yourself a favour and use a more robust company."
Luke Epp,US,"Apr 18, 2018",1,This company is a scam,"This company is a scam. They will refuse to remove your credit card from your account, refuse to cancel your services, and refuse to refund you for any charges in the past. I had to cancel my credit card to stop these charges and am currently working with my legal team to try to sue and recover some of my money but, since they are based in Paris and I am in the US, it seems as if it may not be worth the costs of an international case. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. The prices are attractive because they will refuse to turn those prices off when you realize that the servers are built on some of the worst, most failure prone architecture around. Furthermore, the support agents are rude and condescending."
Wei Zhang,GB,"Apr 16, 2018",1,Avoid them,"Avoid them, you will lost all your data without any recovery. 1. You can not make snapshot while the server is running, which means you have to turn off your server to make a snapshot backup 2. You can not make snapshot automatically, you have to login to the control panel to do it. 3. If they experience a hardware failure, such as hard drive failure, there is no way to recover your data from them, if you don't have a recent backup, your website is gone completely If you have plenty of time to spend and can afford unexpected data lose, you can still use them, but I would recommend anyone who have a serious business running to avoid them."
