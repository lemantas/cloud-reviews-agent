Reza Abdi,NL,"Jun 15, 2025",3,The website is good,"The website is good, but it has a few problems: 1. For virtual servers, the control panel is not visually available to users.There would be fewer problems if this control panel was visually accessible to users."
Steven,US,"May 15, 2025",5,Trustworthy service,"I love that when your account runs out of credits, it doesn't autobill your card unless you specifically set that up. A different service cost me a lot of money because they only allowed autobilling. So Cherry Servers is great for that! They also have a pretty good selection of servers and their customer service is quite good as well."

kiwami,JP,"Jan 27, 2025",5,Friendly Technical Support and Flexible Usage Plans,"The support is very fast, making it reassuring to rent a server. The technicians are kind and provide helpful configuration suggestions, which was very beneficial. Additionally, the option to pay per hour allows for flexible server usage, making it easy to test and evaluate different setups."
Customer,GB,"Jan 1, 2025",1,Hello,"Hello, firstly, this company has a limited IP range, secondly, the price of their servers is very high compared to other places, thirdly, if there is a problem when paying with cryptocurrency They do not give the user a correct answer and do not try to fix the problem. The servers only have the option to turn them off and on. There are no restart options on the servers. Thanks."

I told them this is unacceptable from a company to happen, what if their servers are ""not functional"" and our business is affected. Unreal! The support team told me: ""Justas: Things tend to break, and for unknown reasons, the login system isn't working right now. If this is causing you a lot of trouble you can freely use other provider services."""

Nenad M.,RS,"Mar 21, 2024",5,Review after 1 year using Cherry Servers,"I used their dedicated servers for a year and this is my opinion of Cherry Servers. During the time I used the server there were only 3 maintenances from the server provider and every time it happened I was informed at least a day before. Surprisingly it never interfered with my services and I ran the server without any problems. Their support is great and ready to help. For example I had a problem with the payment not going through and lucky me I decided to do the payment the last day. I reached out to support about the problem and they extended the period by 24 hours plus they helped with the payment go through. Their support team usually responds quickly. Their prices are very reasonable for the quality of service they provide. So here are my pros and cons about using Cherry Servers Pros: - Great customer support - Very dependable servers, there wasn't a single hiccup in a year - Servers can additionally get configured if you need any more RAM or Storage space for example, or maybe you need more Backup storage or maybe you need a GPU - They do have some basic ""how to set up"" guides that could be helpful for beginners - If you are into crypto or are doing some crypto related stuff than this info will be useful: Cherry Servers is pro crypto and they accept crypto payments Cons: - I am kind of nitpicking here but the only thing that is bothering me is their dedicated server selection. Sometimes the servers just get taken fast. So if you find the server you like check if there are any in stock."
customer,EE,"Feb 17, 2024",5,Very professional,"Very professional, friendly, flexible service. Only adding hosting side DNS management could make it even better. Anyway all good, definite 5+"
joel,FR,"Jan 16, 2024",4,Good and affordable Cloud servers,"Cherry Servers is a good cloud provider. Prices are cheap, but you get excellent hardware and accurate support. When I had issues, they were always there to solve them. The only point where they can improve is the availability of a box in a decent time. For example, often, when you order a dedicated server, it takes more than 15 minutes to pop up. So I hope that can improve on this side. Finally, I really happy to use Cherry Servers !"
CREADIV,RO,"Jan 3, 2024",2,SMTP services (emails)…,"If you are using SMTP services (emails) the limits are ridiculos - 2 emails sent per machine per hour. The bad thing is that they don't seem to mention these limits before paying for the services. ""SMTP error from remote mail server after end of data: 450 4.7.1 Temporary delayed by rate limit for new clients, try later (2/h)"" ToS section 6.4. ""Cherry Servers reserves the right to monitor outgoing SMTP service traffic for security and spam prevention purposes."""

Adam,AU,"Feb 14, 2023",5,Above and beyond: Best support ever,"We started with a single box to test, then scaled quickly with some very unique and complicated requirements. I've been renting servers in one form or another for the last 15+ years, and I can honestly say we've never had the level of support that we've experienced with Cherry Servers. We highly reccomend them! Pricing has also been really competitive, which is very important during a bear market. NOTE: They are also a Crypto Proof of Stake (PoS) Validator Friendly service provider for their bare metal boxes!"
