Recently, I ran into an issue because my bank card was blocked, and I requested a refund to my USDT wallet instead. I have contacted their billing team, and they have been responsive and understanding, which I really appreciate. However, I still haven’t received the refund. I hope this gets resolved soon. Overall, Vultr has good support, but I am waiting for the completion of my refund before I can give a full 5-star rating."

Lucas Nguyen,VN,"Aug 14, 2025",4,A loyal user since 2016: Great performance but a frustrating registration process,"I have been a loyal Vultr customer since 2016, consistently relying on their services to host a wide range of websites. Their platform stands out for its excellent performance-to-price ratio and flexible hourly billing, which makes managing costs for various projects incredibly efficient. The user interface is clean and intuitive, allowing for the rapid deployment of new servers in just a few minutes. Over the years, whenever I've needed help, their support team has proven to be responsive and effective, providing clear solutions to my questions. For core performance, value, and ease of management, Vultr remains a top-tier choice. Despite these strengths, the service is significantly hampered by an overly strict and frustrating account verification process. I have repeatedly encountered issues when setting up accounts for my clients, as my attempts are often flagged for ""abuse,"" likely due to registrations from a shared IP address. This creates an unnecessary obstacle for legitimate, paying users who are ready to use the service. While fraud prevention is important, Vultr's current system is a major deterrent, and they should reconsider this aggressive approach to make their platform more accessible to new, genuine customers."
James Clear,NZ,"Aug 13, 2025",1,"SLA is a Joke – Lost Revenue, Got $20 Credit","We had a major outage on one of Vultr’s load balancer nodes that lasted over 13 hours, causing serious business damage – lost revenue, bad reviews from customers, and hours of wasted engineering time. The fault was entirely on Vultr’s side, starting right after their maintenance window. From the start, I told their support team that the problem seemed to be with their load balancer nodes. Instead of investigating properly, I got a canned response. If they had taken my report seriously and acted quickly, the downtime could have been reduced from 13 hours to 4–5 hours. Their own system displayed the message: “Some Load Balancer Nodes may be down. Please create a support ticket to fix this issue.” I provided detailed evidence showing our instances were healthy and the fault was within Vultr’s infrastructure. Per their SLA, outages over 7 hours qualify for the highest credit tier — “672 hours (1 month)” — but the fine print means this only applies to the cost of the single affected service item. In our case, that was just the load balancer node, worth about $20. So despite a massive service failure and the real business costs it caused, they hid behind SLA wording and offered the bare minimum. If you’re running anything critical, don’t be fooled by the “100% uptime guarantee.” It’s marketing spin, and when something goes wrong, you’ll get a canned response, slow action, and pocket change for compensation."
Mounti man,IQ,"Aug 13, 2025",1,Disaster company,"Not surprised that this company has one of the lowest rating on trust pilot, its a disaster and waste of money.

Kim Yoonkyung,US,"Aug 13, 2025",1,Account Terminated Without Clear Explanation — Lost Money,"My experience with Vultr has been extremely negative. The company requested a photo of a bank card but could not answer a direct question about which specific card they wanted, even though there are no charges from them in my bank account. While I was trying to clarify this, my server was offline, and I lost around $40 on advertising. Instead of providing a clear explanation, Vultr sent me a formal notice claiming a Terms of Service violation and immediately terminated my account. I never received any specific details about what rule was allegedly broken. The result — lost access to my project, wasted money, and zero real support. My advice: think twice before trusting them with your business. Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)"
NE,DE,"Aug 1, 2025",1,"Five Years and $2,000/Month Wasted: Vultr's GPU Service is a Nightmare","As a Vultr customer for five years, during which I've spent approximately $1,500 USD to $2,000 USD every single month on their services, my experience has devolved into utter disappointment and frustration. What began as a promising partnership has become a persistent nightmare, forcing me to now actively plan the migration of all my critical services. The core of my dissatisfaction lies with critical, recurring infrastructure failures, specifically impacting their GPU instances. My GPU server frequently becomes ""Unlicensed,"" rendering it completely useless for extended periods. This isn't an isolated incident; it's a fundamental, persistent flaw within their system that they seem incapable of resolving. Despite their ""fixes,"" the problem always returns. My own investigations consistently point to a deep-seated misconfiguration on Vultr's end, not an issue with my setup. Compounding this technical incompetence is an abysmal support experience. Despite the significant amount of money I invest monthly, I'm consistently met with unhelpful, repetitive responses, a clear lack of understanding of the problem's gravity and persistence, and a general indifference to my critical downtime. I've been repeatedly assured these issues wouldn't reoccur, only to have the exact same problem resurface, proving their assurances are worthless. The real-world impact has been devastating. I recently endured over 22 hours of downtime for one incident, for which I received a meager $50 USD in compensation – a pittance compared to my monthly spend and operational losses. Worse, the server broke down again the very next day with the identical issue, and it has now been down for two full days. This level of unreliability, combined with their inability to provide a permanent solution, is simply unacceptable for a service at this price point. For anyone considering Vultr, especially for mission-critical services or GPU instances, consider this a grave warning. Their infrastructure has severe, recurring flaws, and their support team is ill-equipped to handle serious problems. After five years, my only regret is not leaving sooner. Save yourself the headache and significant financial losses."
Nico,DE,"Updated Aug 1, 2025",1,"Five Years In, and Deeply Regretting Vultr","After five years as a Vultr customer, spending around $2,000 monthly, I'm genuinely shocked and deeply disappointed by the recurring issues and the abysmal support I've received. What started as a promising service has devolved into a constant headache, and I'm now actively looking to migrate my services elsewhere. The core of my frustration lies with a persistent and critical GPU licensing issue on my GPU server. This isn't a one-off glitch; it has happened multiple times, causing significant and unacceptable downtime. Each time, my GPU becomes ""Unlicensed,"" rendering my server useless. The ""fix"" from Vultr has consistently been to tell me to manually recreate the nvidia-gridd.service file, which inexplicably vanishes. I've done this repeatedly. Yet, even when the service file is present, the daemon starts, attempts to acquire a license from nvidialic.vultrlabs.com, and then immediately dies. My own troubleshooting, which frankly, Vultr support should be doing, has revealed the root cause is on their end. My server can connect to their licensing server on port 443, but their server is rejecting the request with a ""400 Bad Request"" error, stating ""The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port."" This is a fundamental misconfiguration on Vultr's side, not mine. Despite spending a substantial amount of money monthly, the support experience has been nothing short of infuriating. I'm met with repetitive requests for logs I've already provided, a clear lack of understanding of the problem's persistence, and a general impression that they're more annoyed by my tickets than concerned about resolving a critical, recurring issue. I was even told this wouldn't happen again, yet here we are. This latest incident has cost me 14 hours of critical downtime, and Vultr's inability to provide a permanent solution or even a competent diagnosis is unacceptable. For anyone considering Vultr, especially for GPU instances, be warned: their infrastructure has fundamental flaws, and their support will leave you high and dry. I regret my five-year commitment. Edit: I got compsensated for $150 USD for the downtime of 22 hours. Edit 2: It's the next day, and the GPU is unlicensed again. Same issues. Support was not helpful at all. I feel like they have no understanding about the hardware they are selling."
Sean McHugh,US,"Jul 28, 2025",1,Their Kubernetes platform is effectively unusable.,"They limit the number of nodes you can create/destroy in your kubernetes cluster. It makes it impossible to build anything. They will arbitrarily limit you to creating 5 nodes a day. Like, you know, what an autoscaler does. They don't make it clear how to lift these restrictions, why they were put in place, or how they even make sense since you have to pay to create the instances so there should be no problem in any case. I deeply regret building with Vultr."

The Vultr Support Team either passes the buck or fails to resolve issues, showing poor management. The server rental prices are exorbitant, the performance is slow, and errors are frequent.

Please review our AUP at .../legal/use-policy.” They charged around $50 to my bank account without any prior notice (this happened before I submitted a support ticket).

With barebones web servers starting at $2.50 a month it all just feels super easy and unbeatable. I've had no issue destroying servers / dropping services / etc. Honestly, I was surprised to see their Trustpilot rating wasn't super high. I've never had to contact customer service, maybe that's the difference.

I had an absolutely terrible experience with Vultr, and I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this scam company. Their customer service is non-existent, and their platform is misleading. They promise services, but once you add your credit card, they charge you without providing any actual instance or service. In my case, they charged me $68 without reason, and after contacting my bank, it was proven to be financial fraud. Despite repeated attempts to reach out to their support team, I received no response or resolution. I wasted hours trying to get my money back, but their team either ignored my complaints or gave generic, unhelpful responses. It’s clear that Vultr is running a shady operation with unfair billing practices. They take your money without delivering the promised service and leave you stranded. I wouldn’t trust them with any personal or financial information. If you’re considering Vultr, please think twice—there are far more reliable and trustworthy alternatives out there.

Despite that, you limit my account, accuse me of violating your Acceptable Use Policy even though I had not yet configured the VPS, and threatened to suspend my account if I don't respond within 48 hours?

Thang Tran,VN,"Nov 13, 2024",1,Vultr support team attitude and delay is terrible,"I am a long-time customer of Vultr. The longest VPS registered continuously is 7 years. I am currently having problems with my account, and my Tikets support has been suspended since last weekend (maybe because this is a holiday and weekend) so it took me 4 days to receive a response, I was asked to wait, and wait for my turn to be supported. You said 99.95% Uptime, that is a joke I am extremely disappointed with the way the Vultr support team works. Not only is the response process from your side slow, but the support attitude is also unenthusiastic, the answers are so short that they are abrupt, not showing the professionalism and dedication that customers expect. I hope Vultr seriously reviews and improves its customer support methods, improves the quality of service and the attitude of the support staff. This is the least a loyal customer can expect."
Carlos,US,"Nov 11, 2024",1,Horrible support,"I had a pretty frustrating experience with Vultr trying to get the SMTP port unblocked so I could send emails from my website. After opening a support ticket, it took hours to even get a response. When they finally replied, they asked for a bunch of info—most of which I’d already included in the ticket! Then, they kept piling on more questions, making the whole thing way harder than it needed to be. I gave them everything they asked for and then waited almost a full day, just to be told they wouldn’t unblock it. This whole process felt like a huge hassle and really affected my site. I hope Vultr rethinks how they handle these requests to make it easier for people who actually need the support. For me that's all with them I've moved everything to another company and will never do business with them again."

I wrote to them and they said they needed the request from someone at Vultr to remove it from their list. So I submitted a ticket to Vultr asking them to simply request the removal -- I told them the web site address and e-mail address to write to. They said, ""Upon review, fulfilling an unblock request for MIPSpace will not be possible; we are unable to assist you with this matter."" Unable? So they cannot send e-mail nor access any web sites? I find that hard to believe. They went on to say, ""As email reputation is nearly impossible to maintain on cloud instances, we advise that you use SendGrid or other third-party mailing tools, rather than the cloud instance itself, to circumvent this issue. We are closing this ticket."" Seems like they just told me to get lost, they don't want my business. So that's what I'm doing, and I recommend the same to anyone reading this."

Sort of: - If you are a non-tech person hoping to have someone handhold you through running a server, forget it. Their service department is what they say they include: Only if the server is having issues with networking on performance related to degraded status. They do NOT offer a managed service for basic VPS. And that's OK. This isn't Shopify or NetSuite. I'm not sure where all these negative reviews are coming from. Perhaps people thinking they can run an AI/ML or Minecraft server on a $5 VPS like DO offers and not get white-glove service? I'm not saying Vultr is perfect, no hosting provider is.

Also, the costs have always been predictable and affordable in comparison to other options such as AWS, GCP, or Azure. We've never encountered the need to switch in all this time, despite dealing with complex business and regulatory requirements.

Waiting a week just to be told they can’t even enable the GPU usage on your account is absurd. Their failure to address the issue in a timely manner shows a complete disregard for your time and resources. Why should customers be expected to shell out money upfront when they can’t even deliver the service? The fact that they left you hanging for a week, offering no solutions or communication, speaks volumes about their lack of competence and customer care. It’s frustrating and a blatant red flag when a supposedly professional service provider wastes users' time with inadequate processes and support.

I don't have time to send dozens of separate abuse reports, one per IP address, and Vultr's abuse team is counting on that. I suspect that Vultr's abuse team has a list of ""bulletproof hosting"" customers against whom they will not take action.

I have now blocked all Vultr IPs at our firewall. They no longer have access to any of our web, email, cloud storage, VPN, or other servers.

The attack originated from six IP addresses managed by Vultr Holdings Corporation. Despite multiple reports and requests for assistance, Vultr's technical support and abuse teams did not respond, allowing the attack to continue and escalate network difficulty to an unmanageable level. This negligence has caused our company an estimated loss of $675,000 due to halted block production, increased operational costs, and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, we have reported this issue to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Department, the FBI, the FTC, and other regulatory bodies.

I don't understand why the rating is so low on Trustpilot, I think they need to ask happy customers to review otherwise only unhappy folks will leave the 1-star reviews. Not a service for folks who don't know what they are doing. Use GoDaddy or Siteground if you want a more user friendly control panel and all the support and hand holding.

Unhappy,PL,"May 3, 2024",1,What a fuc king scam!!!!,What a fuc king scam!!!! I wanted to rent a GPU server and registered an account. After chosing which server i wanted it asked me to make a deposit via credit card which i did.So it charged my credit card and i had to rechoose again the server setup i would like. However now its telling me that i need approval from their support to buy any service from them. So i contacted their stupid support which needed 2 full working days to reply on my request to tell me i should fill out my profil and tell them for what its needed. I told them my profil was already filled out before and there was also a full description for what i was going to use their service. Later i received a reply telling me again to fill out my profil and describe for what i need their service. So i made a very long post so even the most stupid guy on the world would understand it. As a reply i received the information that this kind of service i can only apply after having an account for at least 60 days and building up trust. What a nonsense.But the best part is coming. I'm even not able to buy a small instance for $70 as i get no approval. I demanded of course for a full refund of my deposited money which all i get is silence. BEWARE SCAMMERS

They now want to play thought and word police and will remove your app or website if anyone takes any offense at all to any of your content. Here is a section of their thought police policy Offensive Content. Content that is harmful to minors in any way, defamatory, libelous, obscene, abusive, threatening, discriminatory, harassing, invasive of privacy, false, intentionally misleading, patently offensive, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, depicts non-consensual sex acts or that promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, religious intolerance, misogyny, or physical harm of any kind against any group, individual or animal. Basically anything that can in any way offend anyone in any way. I can understand the porn BS but the rest is asinine. So who decides what is hatred or bigotry or religious intolerance etc. etc. And why misogyny and not misandry? After nearly 10 years, I recently removed my websites and will not suggest this hosting ever again to anyone ever. I wrote articles about how great Vultr was and how to use their API's and much more. Why would I risk putting customers on a platform like this where their website could randomly be shutdown at anytime? That would make me look bad. It was great while it lasted, but I won't wait around for surprises and I won't let my customers get angry at me because they typed a no no thought. These days everyone is so easily offended. Don't use Vultr. I noticed this BS policy updated when I signed in and it wanted me to agree to it. I immediately shut everything down. I hope their wokeness hits them like Bud Light and all the other pathetic woksters. I hope that vanguard and blackrock money is really worth it. Hey VULTR HERE'S AN IDEA. STICK TO HOSTING AND HOSTING ONLY GTFO OF WORD POLICING. hostgator and others don't have thought police BS use policies. I'll never suggest them to anyone ever again. I'll never use them for any customers ever again. Use them at your own risk. And damn sure don't use them for any customers who might get a nasty surprise if they type something some pronouner doesn't approve of and their site gets reported and shutdown.

Ray,GB,"Dec 16, 2023",1,Horrific Service & Support. Avoid at all costs!,"I think it would be fair to say that when the founders of Vultr decided to build a hosting company they all sat down and said ok guy’s, lets make by far the worst hosting company on the planet! You would have to think that when David Aninowsky, J.J. Kardwell, David Gucker, David Gucker, David Gucker and Mike Marinescu look at the reviews of their company they must say hey guys we are obviously doing really well! Vultr is without question the worst hosting company we have ever come across since the dawn of the internet. The arrogance of this company and specifically the almost non existent support is to behold and if you are considering Vultr then I seriously suggest you look at all the negative reviews because they are mainly true and with so many better alternatives my advice is look elsewhere! The short experience we have had with them defies all belief but we have decided to detail just a few of their failings otherwise we would be here forever. Firstly do not believe any of the marketing suggesting use credit, in some places I see $250 credit and indeed we took this offer up but there is no offer, you sign up and there is nothing and you immediately start paying for what can only be described as a mediocre service. It’s true that Vultr provides great documentation to get you up and running but that slips into insignificance with the way they run things. So picture this, we run a website that is not very large, medium traffic but way within side any of the perimeters we were operating in and we had been using one instance with Vultr for about 3 weeks with no issues and then suddenly our website was throttled to 25% of its CPU usage with totally killed the site, it would not load and was a disaster for us especially just before Christmas. We received and email from Vultr saying: Based on monitoring results and subsequent analysis, we have determined your CPU resource utilization profile is excessive and causing performance issues which may unfairly affect the population of Vultr subscribers as a whole. Accordingly, we have limited the maximum CPU resources your instances can consume (an account-wide setting). If you are able to reduce the performance impact we have observed, we may be able to adjust the limit or remove it altogether. Thank you for your cooperation! Staggered by this we checked everything and there was certainly no increase and anything other than than norm so we complained that we are not seeing this, where have you got this from and you have killed our site and we are loosing money. Support on this was non existent and in normally takes 24hrs to get any reply and this was what we got: Hello, Our formal service limitations are listed in our acceptable use policy; however, if subscribers exceed an acceptable level of usage and results in degrading overall system performance, we have the right to limit the account. We have set resource limits on your account due to high resource utilization that was impacting the performance for other customers on the same host node. You may petition to have these limits removed by maintaining consistently lower utilization for two weeks and then replying to this ticket. Please keep in mind that demonstrating normal account usage does not include leaving the account dormant. Thank you for understanding. Our policies for more information: Optimized Cloud Instances: --Vultr Trust & Safety-- Yes people you read that right, these CLOWNS are going to kill our site for 2 weeks by throttling the CPU to 25% meaning it could not be used anyway but they wanted us to pay for them killing it. As you can see there is no argument, there is no way round, its all over, they kill your site, your business and couldn’t care less. We can only assume David Aninowsky, J.J. Kardwell, David Gucker, David Gucker, David Gucker and Mike Marinescu think this is all ok, killing their clients websites and businesses is ok and leaving them with zero alternatives, what a bunch of clowns. So, my advice is to do what we did and moved to Digital Ocean and put the cretins at Vultr behind us. Working with Digital Ocean has been a dream, great support and the simple fact is we have piece of mind that some no mark is going to ruin our business for the sake of absolute nothing….. who would do that? Oh yeh… David Aninowsky, J.J. Kardwell, David Gucker, David Gucker, David Gucker and Mike Marinescu"
Erik,CA,"Dec 12, 2023",5,I can't get away from these guys,"I can't get away from these guys. I can't because the other hosting companies kind of suck. Everything with vultr is easier, the spooling up of a new server, setup of keys, implementing a account wide firewall, monitoring, backups and snapshots. I admin 3 servers, 2 w. plesk and one vpn. it's much easier than the popular ones out there, liquid, fly, digital, etc. I even tried a recent one, SUPER fast on double the ram, just a bit more than vultr- the ""3rd"" party ratings on this server were something I couldn't ignore- crunchb. did a head to head on a bare install of WP, measured thru all the popular website speed testing- 50% slower than vultr. CONS If you are doing a PBN, footprint would be huge if its all at the same company- any pbn at the same company different IP would be a tell. so thats not reall a con. But the email server set up- that does suck, as you have to use Vultr as your NS. Vultr's NS are not as good or as fast as other dedicated NS providers. This only pertains if you have a Plesk control panel and are hosting your email thru that- otherwise if you are with say, microsoft365 you just make the relevant changes at your domain register or DNS provider same as always. Also I cannot seem to get their apps for VPNs to ever work, so I use a github script to set up wireguard for me on a vanilla ubuntu install."
Tawfik Dukhan,DE,"Dec 11, 2023",1,Vultr's Deceptive Marketing and Unjust Fees,"I'm utterly disappointed with the deceitful practices and unjust charges levied by Vultr. My experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share it with others to prevent them from falling victim to this company's misleading offers. Upon signing up, I was enticed by Vultr's alleged $250 credit promotion, only to witness this credit vanish into thin air immediately after making a payment. How could a supposed credit disappear without explanation? To add insult to injury, deploying an instance resulted in direct charges, contrary to the promised credit. When I raised my concerns through the ticketing system, instead of a resolution, I received an unhelpful and dismissive response from the Accounts Team, implying that my debit card was ineligible for promotions, without prior notice or clarification during the signup process. Furthermore, their attempt to manipulate the situation by instructing me to destroy active instances before addressing my request for cancellation is absurd and manipulative. It seems Vultr is more focused on keeping instances active to continue accruing charges rather than addressing legitimate customer grievances. The staff's response lacks empathy and fails to acknowledge the issue of false advertising and unauthorized charges. This is a clear case of misleading customers with fake promises and then conveniently shifting the blame to payment methods to justify their actions. My experience with Vultr has been nothing short of a scam. They use deceptive marketing tactics to lure customers in, only to hit them with unexpected charges and offer zero support when issues arise. It's appalling how they handle customers' concerns and blatantly ignore their responsibility in this matter. I strongly advise against trusting Vultr's promotions or services. Their lack of transparency, unhelpful customer service, and propensity to charge without justification are clear indicators of a company that prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction and honesty. I regret engaging with Vultr and strongly caution others to steer clear of this deceitful company."

Mal,US,"Oct 8, 2023",5,Updated Review 1 Year Later,"I reviewed Vultr about a year ago. I've personally and professionally been using Vultr for about 4 years now. My initial complaint was regarding their managed database offering. It had restrictions that hindered my personal workflow. I have recently returned to test Vultr's database service and come to find that they have made many adjustments to make their managed database solution viable for me and many more people with similiar use cases. I just cancelled with Linode after they just informed me of the discontinuation of their managed databases due to bad infra. I also had to leave Cloudways because of DigitalOcean. I just popped up a plesk node with Vultr and it was flawless. Not to mention the first free month of plesk pro. Vultr has been amazing. I don't know 100% yet if the null route problem is gone because I haven't been DDoSed just yet. But if that stands I still find that to be a major problem. So let me run my easy to understand list Pros: + Vultr cares about feedback + Product Offerings(compute w/ dif specs, dbs, backups, etc) + Reliability(For my regions) + Deployment Cons: - NOT CRITICAL: I wish I could see more info about my individual nodes in my Managed Database. - For Managed Databases allow us to select backup time(if this is a feature then I'm blind). Not a con or pro but dark mode still needs a little bit of work. The Plesk app icon in dark mode is basically gone because of the background color. The view tickets on the top bar are also hard to see. Love you guys <3"

I own total two instance currently in Los Angeles and Tokyo. and both have really nice ping. I using Los Angeles instance as OpenVPN server for watch Anime from Japan, but I do not feel ANY latencey at all. this is really amazing. secondly, I using my Japan server for host blog, and I running few websites and software but it's working withour crash. this mean they offer nice hardware. thirdly, their pricing is great and worth it. if 3.5$ plan on every location it will be better. I can recommend this VPS Provider for personal and medium use. For large use, Maybe you should get dedicated server from another famous providers. ( VPS is not good for lage use i guess so )"
Richard,GB,"Sep 13, 2023",1,Stay away from these scam artists.,"Stay away from these scam artists. Signed up for a trial as they had some interesting features I wanted to try. Found a $250 credit introductory offer that was successfully applied - until they withdrew it without notification and then expected payment for the services used. When questioned, they suggested they had detected that I wasn't actually a new customer so didn't qualify. I'd never heard of them, let alone used them before so I asked for the evidence, which doesn't seem to exist. They have made a vague suggestion that my credit card is associated with another account - which is a daft thing to say as I can easily prove I have no payment history with them. I suspect the reality is they withdrew the credits as I had a dispute with customer services over their somewhat lacking security practices and they decided I didn't deserve free credit (as it was just after this conversation that they were withdrawn). Shame really as security practices aside they had some unique selling points and I would have carried on using them. Lucky escape though I think - clearly not a reputable or moral company. Personally I would encourage you all to sign up for a trial account and use as much free credit as you can - just make sure they can't take payment when they withdraw the credits (I had to cancel my card to stop them being able to take payment)."

Vultr suspended the server in about 3 days because we had a BitTorrent download a movie on it. It was absolutely ridiculous. They wanted lengthy explanations and promises about how this would never happen again, and we had to be profusely sorry about it. And blah blah blah. Finally after about a WEEK, they re-activated it (This was all while I was overseas in a country with zero access to the normal internet). After about a week they blocked it again. They wanted a followup promise and essay on why downloading movies is bad, and how I should be ashamed of myself and how i'm really just a worthless human being. So did that... Then they re-activated it AGAIN. Then a week later the useless sycophants suspended it again. And this time permanently. At that point I knew I'd lost my 350$ investment, and there was nothing I could do. Another Hollywood billionaire complained about a movie download, and how i'm just so so bad, and Vultr just absolutely did everything they could to please the billionaire and disregard ME their customer a poor traveling hippie who can't even check his email.

In that time I've had no downtime that I've noticed - I've had one support ticket, asking for SMTP to be opened which it was. One of my servers is about to be binned off due to the OS going end of life in 4 or 5 months so have done a quick search about to explore new possibilities while planning to replace it. Actually shocked to see so many bad reviews on here - and people complaining about being asked to provide ID, I don't remember ever having to do that. But I understand why Vultr would ask, don't really want a load of scammers hosting fake ads and tech support scams and malware so quite reasonable IMO.

With all the other companies i contacted they repaid any owed money and closed the account down. A few months later i noticed they were still taking payments. I created aa new ticket and they said that in the first ticket they gave me instructions about how to shut down the server. I missed that and they were not very clear, plus i'm not technical and i no longer had a dev to help me. At this point, you'd expect them to apologise for not switching it all down and pay back the money they had taken. No, they insisted that i owed them more money. Absolutely terrible customer service, idiotic behaviour. First time i've been compelled to write a negative review but they fully deserve it.

Luke Escude,US,"Jun 27, 2022",2,"Lots of downtime, bad support.","Their customer service is pretty bad - They don't have any technicians available on holidays or weekends, so when (not if) your Vultr instances experience downtime or extreme packet loss, you may not hear from anyone for 48 hours+.

Before they fix it though, they make you provide MTRs and pings to prove the downtime without actually doing any of it themselves - They like it when you do their jobs for them.

The misery at Vultr is indescribable! A YouTube tutorial told me that for setting up a mail server I should go to Vultr but this turned out to be a lie on all sides! The weird thing is that when you create an account you have to add a payment method and they don't accept that you just want to add it. You must necessarily add a minimum amount of $10 to your account before you can even look at the options from which you want to set up your server. The trouble started when it turned out that the e-mail ports seemed to be blocked by default on newly created servers at Vultr and a ticket was submitted for this by default. Nothing crazy about it! Had to go to Linode too. At Linode, the gates were opened within a day without too much fuss. After 2 minutes I already had a response from a ""System Administrator"" who indicated that the ticket should be forwarded to the account management team for review. About 8 minutes later, however, I got an email back from a Customer Support Representative asking why I wanted the email ports open. After 15 minutes I sent a response explaining that I do not intend to do mass mailing and I only use the mail server for personal purposes. 16 and a half hours later(!!!) I get the response that they don't intend to open the e-mail ports for me after all. The account was too new! I responded within 45 minutes with the message that Vultr then literally turns out to be a useless option for me and I would like a refund of the amount I spent on the server. 2 DAYS AND 4 HOURS LATER I get a response from an account analyst that it is now suddenly possible. ""The SMTP block has been lifted"" was the message. The only thing I had to do was restart the server after which the lifting of the SMTP block would actually take effect. Pressed the ""Restart"" button from my control panel: ""Error encountered while restarting"". I'm not confident I'll get a timely response to this issue from support. I'm going for a Rackspace Email Option at Cloudways! UPDATE: After 15 minutes it is possible to start the server again and the blockage has indeed been removed.

Once I was done I didn’t use my instance what so ever but some how racked up a bill of $75?! Upon asking them about this they tried to tell me that I had to pay which is hilarious instantly contacted my bank to refuse payments to the company, they give no warning what so ever of how when your instance is left idle that you have to manually go and “destroy” the server yourself. To anyone thinking about going to this service please don’t. The customer service team drops copy and pasted replies and are a headache to deal with. Avoid at all costs."

Mike,GB,"Updated Jan 7, 2022",2,"Bait and switch, bad business practices, dubious no refund policy","tl;dr I got bait and switched by Vultr vps. I was invoiced out of the blue for features(storage) that were always free in an inactive account(no instances) months after they were destroyed because they decided to start billing their entire customer base for an existing free feature. Classic. Vultr's business practices are questionable in how they get your money(they aren't really as cheap as their advertising makes it seem when you sign up). And apparently they don't ""do"" refunds. Huge red flag there. As other reviewers have said, you should probably stay away. There are a lot of CAPS LOCK segments in their TOS that seem to be them shouting at you ungrateful customers to shut up and because we've already taken your money. lol The funny part is they also shout that the parts that they are shouting might be illegal, and in that case the consumer protection law prevails over these intimidating shouty bits. Bonus points if you can find that statement in the TOS on their website vultr.com My interaction with customer service has been poor as you might have seen from other reviews. It seems they don't actually read your e-mail as they seem to miss many of the points of your tickets and reply with canned responses. I don't know if this is a language thing or they're outsourcing the support. This of course ends up being a time waster for everyone. Basically they tick every check box for a very bad IT provider, except one. Their stuff works last I used it. It's nothin fancy but when I was using it seems to work okay for light application non-production or critical use. But there seems to be a lot of 1 star reviews about their reliability, so take my 2 stars with a grain of salt. Whatever you do don't kid yourself, take Vultr for what it is, a Florida company, a bottom market segment operator hustling for customers with a classic low pricing model. But your instance might go down and you'll get that nagging feeling in your stomach that you're overpaying when your bill comes in. They're a bunch Vultrs I tell ya lol. On a side note I feel like mistakes where made when choosing a name, but I really hope they finish the change to The Constant Company and leave all this unpleasantness behind them so they can hit those numbers and get that sweet VC/exit. Shop around, there are better deals with better companies and good free trials etc. You don't want to be sharing a node with some low segment penny pincher hosting who knows who or what. I'm currently still trying to get a refund. I'll let ya know how that goes. I don't exactly have high soaring hopes."
Andrew Hawken,AU,"Jan 6, 2022",3,"Great Product, Terrible Support","I have enjoyed a great service with Vultr since 2016. No issues, everything has been great. A couple of days ago I submitted my very first support ticket regarding their DNS service. I just wanted the serial corrected (it was showing as 0) on one of my zones. That’s all. I spelled out the problem very clearly. I had to educate the technician that picked up the issue that I was using Vultr DNS, not my own (upon them telling me it was my problem). Why I had to do this I have no idea. A quick lookup on the domain would have shown that information, or maybe they could have viewed the domain on IntoDNS.com, using the link I provided in my opening post. My issue was never resolved, with various technicians telling me ‘everything is fine or if you want to update the serial, deploy your own DNS servers.' I'm not sure what is so hard about updating the serial on a zone file. Perhaps if they were a little more transparent with me on the why, or just looked into the problem instead of trying to close the ticket as quickly as possible, I might be a little more understanding. I’ll remain with Vultr, but I’ll never ask for technical support again."

Aseef,US,"Updated Oct 22, 2021",2,Pros & Cons,"Pros: - One of the (slightly) faster CPUs among VPS service providers (note: I said, VPS NOT dedicated servers) - Offers DDOS Protection - They allow crypto mining (from what I can tell) but if you are detected mining crypto, they will reduce the speeds on your nodes. - Built-in scripts feature in to the panel (never used it though) Cons: - Lures customers through misleading advertisement by offering them free account credits (however the ACCOUNT CREDITS EXPIRE IN 30 DAYS AND DON'T STAY). - Considerably more expensive than competitors like OVH. - The DDOS protection is NOT free. - They limit the number of VPS' you can deploy per month (but you can contact customer service to increase that limit if you are willing to deal with that inconvenience) - Even if you attempt to use a virtual or prepaid card, they will lock your account and ask to see your ID and other personal information. And the verification process is really tedious (show us your id. kay, now show us standing next to your face with your id. kay now also show us this and now that). So don't unless all you got is prepaid/virtual cards. Reasons to choose Vultr: - You will only be using a VPS with them for 2-4 months. In such case, with the free credit they hand out, you can probably get the first month free so Vultr would end up being the cheaper option. - Processing speed is very important to you and you got the extra cash to meet that demand AND YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BUY A DEDICATED SERVER (you can can afford a dedicated server, strongly recommend you go elsewhere because there are much better deals out there)."

Dr. Harold Munir,US,"Oct 21, 2020",1,DO NOT USE VULTR,Vultr is an absolute garbage company. I say this because of how they treat their customers and how they treat they’re paying customers who have been there for a while. Vultr does not care about building long term relationships with customers they only care about volume and could care less if they lose customers every day. For one their prices may seem reasonable but their uptime is absolutely horrendous. They only work well during times of the day there is low traffic. Their excuse is always a “noisy neighbor.” And they do not explain anything else. In fact their customer support is one of the worse I’ve ever experienced in this industry. They take weeks of not months to respond to tickets and they offer no valid response. They ignore your questions and problems and just gloss over what you asking. Apparently every customer support rep is a senior manager. They do not hold their staff accountable to the rude behavior they exhibit to their customers. They will send you random abuse notifications and then shut down your server. When you ask for details as to why that happened and how you can avoid it in the future and provide proof of your server processing details they completely ignore you and never brother to respond. They are utter garbage. For a company based in the United States they are useless and make American companies look bad. For being based in New Jersey you would expect more from their support and customer service. Their management team is extremely poorly run and their support team is non existent. GARBAGE COMPANY STAY AWAY.

You are paying them $20's for essentially a blank windows computer that cant access anything locally or on the web .. Bottom line do not recommend there are better VPS providers out there that actually let you use the VPS as intended this here is a waste of good money.. Edit: I performed a restart of the VPS and found out the password they provided me isn't even correct (The first time it auto logged in) further pushing me away from this service

Fadipps,JO,"Updated Jul 23, 2020",4,My First Impressions:),"I tried there services a year before and did not like it,but I thought why not give it another try, especially after testing ( with a real money) many other hosting companies, and this is my personal impressions and thoughts about Vultr: 1- one of the easiest VPS/Cloud hosting to open an account and run it instantly, compare it to the painful verification process on Digitalocean or Linode . 2- excellent performance from the hosting plans ( please note I use the servers for web apps only). wordpress sites running great with no issues regarding speed or managing resources.( LEMP stack) I compare what I get with my experience with the biggest and most expensive managed hosting companies out there ( the best was LightningBase, my favorite managed hosting. Kinsta and pantheon.) and Vultr servers are better if you looking to grow and need a real resources, specifically the HF plans) and many independent reviews agree that they have one of the best updated hardwares in the industry. 3- very easy to manage the servers via the dashboard ( better than others) I run and delete a tons of servers with no issue. 4- after I read some reviews from customers complain about canceling accounts/suspending! I asked the support team about it and the answers was very clear: no illegal content or service, and be clear about your identity (don't spam/scam). 5- some people complain that vultr could suspend the accounts if they push hard on the servers resources !! also I ask them about this claim and again they was very clear : "" In the case that the specified service does begin to cause performance issues, we will reach out to you regarding the issue prior to any types of suspensions."" and remember you are dealing wit VPS here not a dedicate machines. 6- support, sometimes they reply with less than an hour other times you need to wait a few hours, but they definitely will help you . finally, I fully understand that my first impressions could be changed with time, and I believe that there is nothing like perfect hosting, but there is a few companies that managed to get the best compromises/balance and Vultr is one of those. by they way they don't look like they pay for the reviews as those JUNK hosting companies .. don't believe any review without a real data and avoid : siteground, bluehost, hosgator..etc combinations..this where you should know that every word you read is paid."

Their way can’t proof I am real person using the account but it can resell my personal information, I know it can ask the loan company to lend money if I do that, I think they want to steal my personal information and sell to other company, they never reply about my request using zoom to check, they just want steal my identity for doing illegal activity, it is the first time that I need to do, they suspend my account now and “LOST ALL DATA”, I do ecommerce since 1999, it never happen in my life, please stop to using this company.

VERY easy to navigate and do what you want. Server has been 100% reliable. All support tickets get responded to in <5 minutes when I thought I had an issue... that's at all hours of day and night.

Magnus Lind,SE,"Jul 15, 2020",4,Reliable and powerful servers,"Mostly a trustworthy provider, server performance is on average a bit better than the competition but on plans with shared resources they can get a little upset if you use too much for too long time and start to rate limit you usage, I'm fine with rate limits but it shouldn't really be a big deal. Just be open and honest with how much resources can actually be used. 17 locations under the same provider that can be managed via the same API is great. They seem to expand with new locations every now and then which is also great. Prices are very reasonable but the larger plans can be a bit pricey, I guess it's because of the dedicated resources. Like many others these days additional IPv4 addresses is hard to obtain and sending emails over port 25 is nearly impossible, not because I personally need those features but many people seems to want that. Firewall is ok but it only blocks incoming traffic so it's not really suitable for reselling yet as you can't really prevent your own customers from doing naughty stuff."

If anything, I love this service. - Neatly designed control panel with all the features I could want/need: instance summaries, resource usage, backups, DDoS protection on/off, snapshots, DNS, settings (IPv4/IPv6, private networking, rDNS, Firewall, Hostname, Plan, etc.), block storage, etc, etc. - Custom OSes supported. (Upload your own ISO.) - KVM style console access to your VM. Love this. Essential for custom OS installation but also very handy if your VM loses internet access (misconfiguration/other) and you need to bring it back up. - VMs are quick and easy to deploy. - Everything runs like clockwork. - IRC bouncers allowed. - Good value. - Charged by the hour. I love that last feature. If you mess something up in your VM, with a lot of the other hosts you got to start over and pay another overlapping monthly fee. Not with Vultr. I messed up my custom OS install, deleted the instance and re-installed. Only lost a few cents, not a whole month's worth of fees (~$25). ** I'm not encouraging carelessness but that it's good to have peace of mind of knowing you won't lose a lot of money for a mistake that requires redeployment of an instance."
Anon,NL,"Aug 5, 2018",1,I got several good looking offers…,"I got several good looking offers trough advertisements. Turns out none of the promises made in those ads were true. According to their ads you'll get credit for signing up so you can try the services. This is not true, you'll have to pay regardless. In fact I've got multiple accounts and neither of them have gotten anything that was offered. however I am not allowed to delete anything. As for the servers themselves, I wouldn't be surprised if what they spend on their hardware reflects their manipulative marketing strategy."
Danyal Manzar,PK,"Jul 10, 2018",4,Good service,Good service. Reliable servers and decent pricing with lots of payment options. Could be cheaper that is the only reason for 4 stars.
Madison Aubrey,PK,"Jun 22, 2018",1,They are thiefs,"They are thiefs, my servers are all off yet they keep on charging me 20 to 30 dollars per server for no reason every single month.. At the beginning they said we will charge you only on usage and when servers are off you wont be charged. SCAMMERS, STAY AWAY FROM VULTR"
Frank L,BE,"Jun 8, 2018",5,Great company!,"Amazing service, understanding staff and a great server experience."
Kyriakos,GR,"Apr 29, 2018",5,Until now I use some small VPS at 1GB…,"Until now I use some small VPS at 1GB or 2GB. Performance is great, and support is really very fast and direct."
Artilleria666,AU,"Apr 10, 2018",5,Excellent service and support!,
Jonas,NL,"Mar 16, 2018",4,Perfect Performance-Wise,"I will not discuss their support or replies that they given out, since they are an unmanaged hosting and are not obliged to give any explanations or such but their performance on the servers are very good and they have not disappointed me yet. 5 months with Vultr hosting my personal application on a LAMP installment."
Joeri,NL,"Feb 25, 2018",3,Works good in general,"Works good in general, What i don't like is that they are very secretive about their RAID configuration and topics on their forum are removed about it."
Frederik L,DK,"Feb 8, 2018",4,Im a happy user and running a discourse …,Im a happy user and running a discourse forum on a server. I would like to be able to downgrade but else is perfect. Fast and up!
Antonio Von Car,AU,"Jan 29, 2018",2,Wiped out over $6,"This company has almost no customer service at all. Their technical service offered (virtual machine hosting) is i grant you, acceptable, but when I was changing banks recently my account was in arrears $6 they sent me a terse email threatening to delete my servers without notice. Hundreds of hours work down the drain over $6."
Clint,US,"Oct 13, 2017",5,Been using Vultr for a few years now,"Been using Vultr for a few years now. Have not really had much trouble and what I have had was fixed fairly quickly. This is a DIY setup, so you are responsible for your setup and I understood and architected my solution around that. Have only had a couple of minor down times, nothing more than expected. The setup is pretty easy and getting a new server online is very fast. The only downside right now is that their block storage is not available in Dallas, hopefully that will change soon."
kostolevskiy,FR,"Oct 5, 2017",1,Harassing me after i stopped paying,"Harassing me after i stopped paying, extremely annoying"
Declan Marks,GB,"Updated Aug 23, 2017",4,Very good service,"I don't know how people can give this service one star. I have had very good experience with their support. I get a response either same day or next. There VPS have better bandwidth than OVH, Arubacloud and digitalocean. Best VPS I have used by far."
User Name,RU,"Aug 5, 2017",1,I knew their support was god awful but this is on a whole other level,"I knew their support was god awful before coming in. But hey! I don't need support because I'm a professional sysadmin! So I went with that. First sour experience: ISO installation is an all around poor experience. Avoided it as much as I can. I feel like I boot a server into raw RAM easier than booting an ISO. But whatever, I rarely need anything more than vanilla ubuntu. So it's okay. Second sour experience: When boot up a server, you're playing the roulette. 50% of the time your server is will be slow af. Can be dealt with multiple attempts. Annoying but manageable. Now, if that were it I would give it maybe 3 or even 4 stars as all issues are possible to deal with without having to deal with Vultr Support (Which is an oxymoron). BUT! I was running a heavy processing script on a dedicated instance for which I paid 60$/month. Vultr decided to violently shut it down because they THOUGHT that was my instance was compromised and doing DoS attacks, which was not the case. At first I explained the situation, waiting a day and resumed operations. Then they shut it down AGAIN, this time CORRUPTING THE DISK! Worse yet, it was done by their system administrator (Joshua Brand). The inhouse system administrator is incompetent. What does this say about the company? I was able to save the day with fsck. I lost time, I lost money and I have lost my patience with vultr. AVOID!"
A Future,GB,"Jul 14, 2017",1,These people are just stealing money …,"These people are just stealing money from you. They advertise one thing, get money and tell you it has sold out and quote you 5 times the amount. The problem is they take the money BEFORE telling you can't give you what you want although you select it before giving money. These are a joke and to be warned stay well away from them. Should have read the reviews beforehand. :-("
Roger Green,GB,"Jun 4, 2017",1,"Absolutely shocking, please steer clear of these idiots.","Absolutely shocking. We missed one of their emails by one hour and they destroyed the whole sever, costing us a lot of money because it's only possible for us to backup once per week. We lost databases and orders and our printed material was instantly rendered worthless, all because we couldn't respond to a poxy email within three days. If you don't want to be treated appallingly, go elsewhere."
Edata team,PS,"May 11, 2017",1,worst webhosting ever,worst webhosting ever after I paid 50$ they close my account because I sent email try to contacted with them many times but they keep telling my about police stealers
Fabio,DE,"Apr 24, 2017",1,Very bad support,"Very bad and slow support.. I could not even order a server because my account was banned without a reason. I created a second account to contact the support (1 week ago). Now (after 7 days!!) I got an answer that they don't want to host a server because of my activity. I don't understand which activity they mean, but yea.. bad hoster."
Rasanjana Dilan,LK,"Updated Apr 2, 2017",5,Very Good Comapany,Very Good Company. I'm use since 5 months. no issue. no down times. love it :)
Mads Mortensen,DK,"Dec 7, 2016",5,Great Service!,"Hey! If you are reading this is probably because you are trying to get into VPS, Dedicated or other kinda servers. Vultr is a great place to order a dedicated server. I have one there myself. My server is setup with free DDoS protection and it got a running Exile Arma 3 server running 24/7 on it. I have NEVER experienced any downtime or lag. I will recommend this 100% for a stable and cheap dedicated server. //CCG Owner"
Lawrence Shaw,US,"Dec 18, 2015",1,Terminated services without prior notification,"I was a happy customer for 1 year then one day they terminated my VPS completely because of a temporary 80% CPU load spike. Really, what? They advertise KVM VPS's with dedicated resources? Far from being true. Sent tickets to ask for a reactivation but they had already completely deleted the VPS, all data lost and fortunately I had a local backup, 1 month old though. Either do not trust them or if you use them keep frequent backups."
