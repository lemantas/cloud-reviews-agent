Bohdan Khomutskyi,CZ,A day ago,5,"Price-performance is great, very satisfied customer for 7 years. I trust this provider with my data.","I have been using different Hetzner services since 2017: dedicated server, back then unmanaged VPS, then cloud VMs, storage share, storage box and web hosting for my personal projects. I am very satisfied with the service, and especially performance to price ratio, and was surprised to see so snappy disks on web hosting. I'm getting very good performance for the money, and the company is solid - located in Germany, ISO27001 certified, I'm not worried about putting data on their servers. I do highly recommend Hetzner to anyone looking for affordable services with good price to performance."

Tin Nguyen,VN,3 days ago,1,Definitely 1 star - worst service i have ever tried,"I was searching for cheap kubernetes cluster for my apps, then I found a git repo with simple setup guide, it had an affiliate link to Hetzner. Pricing looks very good so I try to signup for an account. I gave them my real payment info in signup process. After over a day, they sent me an email said that ""we have decided to deactivate your account because of some concerns"". What the actual f***? For real? They just cancelled that without giving me a chance to verify. I then sent them an email asking for why, and they said like ""we don't share details, we don't want you"". Again, no option to send ID or passport or whatsoever. But they already have my payment information. Later I saw a small transaction on my card that I did not authorize or know about. I then had to lock my card. I demand them to delete my payment info out of their system permanently, but still did not receive a response. For me, this looks like a scam. Why ask payment first, before verifying an account? At very least, they should ask for ID or passport first before start collecting sensitive information, right? As the title, Hetzner is the worst cloud service i have ever tried. But lucky me, after the rejection, I found a better provider with both spot and on demand pools, which is a perfect solution for me. And more important, it's much cheaper. Ha ha, thanks God."
Quora Forum,PK,4 days ago,5,I am a happy hetzner customer,I am a happy hetzner customer. They have some state of the art servers and hosting for every need and at very affordable cost. Best part is that there vps come with option of backup and a separate snapshot which is very helpful in our case. They have a very excellent hourly billing system. change server requirement any time and you will be asked to pay for only required amount. There server are very fast and now our website is getting consistent high traffic without any down experience.

Matt,CA,Updated 5 days ago,1,Hetzner is abusing your trust.,"Don't trust Hetzner..... These internet scammers always come up with reasons for their systematic thefts and are not accountable to anyone. We had said several times that we didn't want to use this hetzner service and had deleted all the files. They had blocked our access so we could not cancel the service so they could easily steal money from our bank. Even though our service was stopped on August 21st and we notified them by email, they still withdrew money from our bank account for September!! And the response to this theft is not systematic. First, every month the money was withdrawn automatically for that month. Why did they withdraw money again for September?!!"

I signed up with my real information, submitted my driver's licence, waited three full days for their so-called verification process, and was still rejected without explanation. All I received was a generic email claiming my account was ""suspicious"" with no clarification. No reason. No appeal. No opportunity to correct anything. Just permanently blacklisted for something they refuse to disclose. This is not security. It's not fraud prevention. It's a lazy, opaque system that penalizes legitimate users without any accountability. If their internal processes are so fragile that they can’t distinguish between fraud and a verified customer providing government ID, then their system is broken by design. Their support does not engage. You get copy-paste responses and are treated like a liability, not a customer. There is no recourse. No transparency. Nothing. If you're outside the EU or using Hetzner for the first time, understand this risk. You could follow every rule, provide everything they ask for, and still get instantly shut out. You will get no help, no clarity, and no second chance. This was a complete waste of time and one of the worst customer experiences I’ve had with any provider. Stay far away."
Malthe,DK,"Aug 18, 2025",5,Helpful & fast support,"Helpful & fast support, really like their storage boxes. Only downside is DDoS protection, but there are so many 3rd party providers of that in 2025, so that is not a problem."

Fabin cole,US,"Aug 16, 2025",1,"Curse this hosting. Don’t even think of signing up, even by mistake.","If there’s a worst hosting company in the world, it’s Hetzner. If I had the option, I wouldn’t even give them one star—I’d throw a shoe instead. This is the only hosting company on earth that asks you for a passport just for verification. I’ve used SiteGround, A2 Hosting, Hostinger—never had this nonsense. Tried Hetzner once on a client’s request, and it was a complete disaster. First, their so-called “verification” took more than 18 hours, and then they straight up rejected it with a vague line: “due to some concerns.” Concerns? What concerns? Will your mother come and explain the concerns? I literally only entered the basic details—address, number, email—and they demanded a passport like some airport immigration officer. Even worse, there wasn’t any reason at all for rejection, but they still did it. To top it off, my client (who actually lives in Germany) also tried—guess what? Same rejection after 24 hours. Absolute garbage system. Pathetic. A disgrace of a hosting provider."
Comercio Local,BR,"Updated Aug 26, 2025",1,Worst experience I've ever had! Terrible service and support. Not recommended.,"I contracted Hetzner's services through an affiliate link, expecting to receive a $20 credit. However, to my surprise, the company decided not to grant the credit and stated that I would have to pay the full amount. I find this unacceptable, as I was merely testing their services to evaluate whether it was worth hiring a more robust server. I opened a technical support ticket to resolve the issue, but I was informed that nothing could be done and that payment was mandatory. As a result, I removed all my websites from Hetzner and deleted the server I had contracted. I do not recommend Hetzner and do not intend to use their services again. Additionally, the average download speed on their servers was around 300 kbps, rarely exceeding 5 MB/s, which I found unsatisfactory. The company still has much to improve. Don't waste your time. Upadate: This company is fraudulent, and I have reported them to my credit card issuer to avoid any unauthorized charges. Despite canceling the service, they continue to send numerous messages demanding payment. I strongly advise against doing business with this company under any circumstances. They persistently attempt to charge you for services you did not receive, treating it as if it’s completely normal."

Ahmed Raad,IQ,"Aug 14, 2025",1,Hetzner disabled my account and…,"Hetzner disabled my account and cancelled my server over a $13.87 invoice I already paid, locking me out completely — no server, no invoice access, no support dashboard. Worse, their only “solution” was to force a bank transfer — no card, PayPal, or retry option. What kind of hosting company does this in 2025? I replied to their email pointing out their mistake and demanding access, but they never responded. You don’t shut down a customer’s account without a proper dispute process or even a reply. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Avoid Hetzner at all costs — unreliable, outdated, and careless with customer data."
eddy,GB,"Updated Aug 18, 2025",1,"After 4 Years of Loyalty, Hetzner Locked Me Out and Threatened to Delete My Data","I have been with them since 2021. Decent and cheap web hosting. But until some changes in their payment system. Just because my monthly bill is too small, they have merged 3 months into 1 payment. It is not always easy to monitor when the 3 months has done a roundtrip (appreciate the reminders) and when I should expect an invoice. Once it's received, I don't even get a month to react and I get threats that dept collector agency will knock on my door and request the 6€ I owe them. And top of that, my services were blocked and my business got disrupted. The 3 months period and then 2 weeks to get it cleared is unbalanced, locking out and sending threats is shocking. Before coming here, I did emailed them to get to the bottom of this, but the staff who's name I believe is [removed]. was not interested to look at my complaint. Shocking. Not even apologized for disruption of my business. I am rating Hetzner with 2 stars just because they have competitive prices, but the customer care is horrible. If someone from Hetzner is reading this - Do not ask me to follow you up with more details or anything, instead ask your staff who dealt with me and then work it out. You weren't interested to solve my complaint, so now I'm not interested to update this review. Have a great day! Thanks Edit: Name removed, ticket id supplied, star rating updated from 2 to 1. Thanks for treating badly your customers and disrupting their businesses - Hetzner is not a reliable provider."
Ali Jafari,DE,"Aug 13, 2025",5,Outstanding Service and Support – Highly Recommended,"I have been using Hetzner for over three years now, and among all VPS providers I have tried, Hetzner has consistently delivered the best performance by far.

Every time I have contacted them, they have responded quickly, professionally, and with great respect. They have always been there for me whenever I needed assistance.

Cristina,PT,"Aug 9, 2025",1,Awful,"I always do my best to recommend and choose EU-based service providers to work with. We are based in the EU and I want to support EU business. But companies like Hetzner are the reason that the US beats us in everything still. For background, we are a not-for-profit and need to have reliable service providers because we are accountable to our members. Believe me when I say the bad ratings you see here are real. I can’t speak for the quality of their servers because we never got to touch one. But, in all other fronts, Hetzner provides an inferior service. Their dashboard is so archaic and confusing that customers are forced to rely on outdated documentation. The alternative is an unreliable, arrogant support desk with limited office hours (ridiculous in 2025). To top it all off, the company engages in questionable tactics to get their invoices settled. We ended up paying this one single invoice but we didn’t even get to touch the server. In fact, we didn’t even complete the verification process of our domain. First, their support desk works only for limited office hours. And, by then, the whole experience was so negative that we felt very uneasy about transferring our not-for-profit to their servers. So, we gave up. Without completing the verification process, we had no access to the server, supposedly ready for us to use. But they still gave themselves the right to invoice us. It saddens me that EU businesses are still reliant on these primitive, dubious, unreliable service providers. We flushed €79 down the drain from our not-for-profit. That’s a hard one to justify. At least, we now found another EU-based host that has provided us with 24/7 support, a top-notch service and peace, so that we can focus on doing good, which is what we’re here for."
Nadir Belhadj,DZ,"Aug 9, 2025",1,"After 2 Years of Loyalty, Hetzner Locked Me Out and Threatened to Delete My Data","I’ve been a loyal Hetzner customer for over 2 years, paying hundreds of euros to host critical infrastructure for my business — including our email servers, ERP system, GitLab instance, and client-facing applications. Due to a temporary issue with my payment method, I missed one billing cycle — and that’s when everything changed. Instead of treating me like a valued client, Hetzner immediately locked my account, disabled access to all services, and sent me cold, automated messages demanding payment. I reached out multiple times asking the most basic question: ➡️ ""Is my data still safe?"" To this day, I never received a clear answer. They refused to confirm whether my servers or databases were still intact. Yet they continued pressuring me to pay — with vague, threatening messages that my data could be deleted. It felt like blackmail: “Pay first, then maybe we’ll see.” Imagine hosting your entire company’s infrastructure on a provider, only to be shut out completely — with no human explanation, no account access, and no assurance that years of data haven’t been erased. This isn’t just bad customer service. It’s reckless and unethical, especially from a company that knows how critical customer data is. For startups and small businesses, data is everything. 💬 My Message to Hetzner: If you truly care about your customers, especially long-term clients, treat people with respect. Automating service cancellations and refusing to provide clarity on data status while demanding payment is the opposite of professionalism. I’m now warning my clients and partners to avoid Hetzner unless you're ready to risk your data over one small billing delay. There are plenty of hosting providers who understand that business relationships are built on trust, transparency, and human support — not just servers and invoices."

N K,RU,"Aug 5, 2025",2,Hetzner pretends to care about its…,"Hetzner pretends to care about its customers, but as a matter of fact you should expect your account to be immediately permanently banned upon registration should you be located outside of EU. They seem to imply that you can contact them on Reddit or over e-mail with your info and that they will lift the restrictions. I had to send them my ID and proof of identity only for them to ignore both my e-mail and my Reddit messages. Upon asking my EU friend to register there, everything worked out in the end. For the issues I encountered using their services customer support was extremely lacking, shallow, and quite literally did not care about you in the slightest. Other than that, their servers work OK, and for their price, it's actually not that bad, but I would never keep anything serious on Hetzner."

When we contacted hetzner technical support about it, not only they replaced the faulty KVM equipment (it confirmed it was an issue on their end), but they also found a faulty CPU fan and replaced that too without prompt from our end, and free of charge. Any time we had issues, they were able to provide swift and thorough support. Will recommend to anyone searching for a reliable, affordable and supportive server provider"

G.P. Grant,ES,"Jul 31, 2025",1,Customer for 15 years,"Customer for 15 years — total account lockout for one missed service We’ve been a loyal Hetzner customer for over 15 years, with dozens of active and fully paid domains and email services. But recently, due to a single missed renewal of a minor, unused service, our entire account was blocked. This included: • ❌ Suspension of all active and paid services • ❌ Inaccessibility of mission-critical email and domains • ❌ Complete lockout from the admin panel — we couldn’t even log in to manage or pay for anything There was no grace period, no escalated warnings, and no way to resolve it without full account suspension — a shocking policy for any serious infrastructure provider. Blocking access to essential, paid services due to one unrelated, unpaid item is an unacceptable practice. This approach puts businesses at unnecessary risk and shows a lack of consideration for long-term clients. We can no longer recommend Hetzner for professional use unless this rigid policy is changed."

Obbz,GB,"Jul 29, 2025",4,A Victim of Its Own Success,"Hetzner offers a fantastic service with great speeds at a price that's hard to beat. I genuinely cannot fault the quality of their product. The problem, ironically, is that the service is too good for its price. This has led to severe availability issues. I was unable to order any of the VPS servers in my budget across Europe, yet I noticed that more expensive alternatives were always in stock. This forced me to move to another, more expensive provider. I hope to come back one day, but there's no clear indication of when their supply will meet the immense demand. Hetzner has baked a pie so delicious that by the time you get to the counter, there are only crumbs left. I, for one, have no pie now."

Claudio,IT,"Jul 25, 2025",1,Completely Dysfunctional DMCA System,"Terrible Experience with DMCA Abuse Management I had been using Hetzner for several years without major issues, but my recent experience with their DMCA abuse management system was nothing short of disastrous and forced me to switch providers. The Problem: I received four identical DMCA complaints for the same article, all regarding an official 2018 Italian State Police press release: AbuseID:F9872F:1A - Claimant: citysunnews75 (Tumblr) AbuseID:FB3964:21 - Claimant: citysunnews75 (Tumblr) AbuseID:FEBC8B:20 - Claimant: citysunnews75 (Tumblr) AbuseID:1014B81:20 - Claimant: dispatchmetronews.blogspot.com Evidence of Fraud Systematically Ignored: I provided detailed evidence clearly demonstrating the fraudulent nature of these claims: Chronological impossibility: Claimants claimed to have published content BEFORE it was made public by police Official source: The article was based on an Italian State Police press release distributed to all media Widespread publication: The same content appeared on dozens of established Italian news outlets Multiple identities: Four claims for the same content from different sources showed coordinated fraud Inadequate Support Response Despite overwhelming evidence of DMCA system abuse: Completely ignored evidence provided in detailed English Continued issuing new abuse IDs for the same content Threatened IP blocking instead of investigating system abuse Failed to implement protections against multiple fraudulent claims Unacceptable Consequences After four cycles of: Receiving fraudulent DMCA claim Providing detailed response with evidence of invalidity Complete ignorance of evidence New IP blocking threat Hetzner ultimately threatened permanent IP blocking if I didn't remove completely legitimate content, forcing me to: Waste valuable time dealing with fraudulent claims Urgently migrate all services to another provider Endure stress and disruption to protect legitimate content Systemic Problems Identified DMCA system easily abused without validity checks Technical staff lacking understanding of copyright basics for public domain content No protections against coordinated multiple claims Ineffective appeal process that ignores documented evidence Threatening approach instead of customer protection Recommendation AVOID HETZNER if you publish content that could be subject to false copyright claims. Their system is vulnerable to systematic abuse and support is inadequate for complex situations. I migrated to Aruba Cloud which has (I suppose, it is less cheaper, but maybe because they have smart tech support): More robust DMCA claim verification system Competent support that understands legal issues Protections against system abuse Technically sound service ruined by disastrous DMCA management and inadequate support. Services used: VPS Main issue: DMCA system vulnerable to abuse + Inadequate support Warning to Other Users If you run news sites, blogs, or any content-based business, be aware that Hetzner's DMCA system can be easily exploited by bad actors. A single fake complaint can snowball into multiple threats and forced migrations, regardless of how legitimate your content is. The fact that they threatened to block my IP after I provided clear evidence of coordinated fraud shows a fundamental misunderstanding of both copyright law and customer protection."

Darren Revell,GB,"Updated Jul 31, 2025",1,Shockingly poor service provider,"Shockingly poor service provider. Threatened to shut us down due to a font issue. We completed their forms, but they claimed we had not. We sent proof that we had filled out their form, and we asked them to contact our client; they failed to do so. Our client also filled out their forms, which they claimed our client had not filled out. However, we proved that our client had indeed filled out their form and demonstrated the ability to use the font under the Adobe license. Our client also wrote to the font owner and covered the use of the font via Adobe, which the font owner thanked our client for. The form they have you fill out does not permit attachments, but you are to attach proof of purchase. It's an utter shambles of a provider. Thank you for your cut-and-paste reply, which has zero bearing on my complaint and best underlines why you are a very poor supplier. My complain is NOT that you investigated it is that your process to investigate was and remains fundamentally poor, like asking a user to provide an invoice on a form that has no ability to attach and an invoice that is positively moronic. A form which you provide and then multiple times say has not been filled in, despite us sending you your own mail system email which confirmed the forms were filled in. It pathetic."

They have a very nice dashboard. I had the 4vcpu 8gb ram vps for a while but downgraded to 3vcpu 4gb ram after realising i didnt need all that. I also like the fact that instead of blocking email ports outright, they let you request it which stops a lot of email spam IMO. My only complaint is that my account got flagged at first. so I had to either show passport as identificiation or pay a €20 deposit which I did. Also, for those of you who are worried about them having your passport data for verification , if they messed up with your data even once the german data authority or eu authority would probably shut them down without a second thought. So i'm not really worried if I have to provide kyc data at some point."

Juxhin,AL,"Jul 17, 2025",1,"Extremely Disappointed – Discriminatory, Abusive, and Unethical Behavior from Hetzner","I’ve been a Hetzner customer for over 4 years, hosting over 10 servers and hundreds of websites for my business and clients. Without warning, Hetzner terminated my account — no real explanation, no clear evidence, no fair process. It all started when they blocked one server IP. I responded to their message expressing my frustration, and soon after: My entire account was scheduled for deletion. My servers were downgraded to PHP 8.0, without my permission, breaking many live services. I lost access to file management tools and faced difficulties migrating my data (over 500GB still pending). I began receiving fake abuse reports targeting my other healthy servers. Despite my professional tone and history of on-time payments, Hetzner refused to provide logs, explanations, or even comply with my GDPR access requests. I believe this was a targeted and discriminatory act — as an Albanian citizen, I was treated with hostility and disrespect. No customer, regardless of nationality, deserves this. I am now taking this public: Reporting to EU data protection and consumer authorities Publishing the story on Reddit, YouTube, and industry blogs Sharing my experience with IT media and digital rights groups I trusted Hetzner for mission-critical infrastructure — they violated that trust completely. If you value transparency, fairness, and customer support, I strongly advise against using Hetzner."

This is regarding an outstanding balance and is totally unprofessional. How am I able to resolve the issue if you just ignore me? Ticket ref is 2025070203019681 but I don’t know if Hetzner will see this, because they don’t seem to use Trustpilot correctly and haven’t requested my details through the Trustpilot system, so this will probably go no where."

Their infrastructure is rock-solid, performance is excellent, and pricing is more than competitive — but what truly sets them apart is their technical support. On the rare occasions when hardware issues have occurred (a disk failure or a memory fault, for example), their response has been impressively fast and professional. Within minutes of opening a support ticket, a knowledgeable technician was already working on the issue. In every incident I’ve experienced, hardware was diagnosed and replaced within the hour, minimizing downtime to an absolute minimum. The communication from the support team is also clear, transparent, and proactive. They always keep you informed of what’s happening, what steps they’re taking, and when you can expect the issue to be resolved. In an industry where support often feels like an afterthought, Hetzner truly delivers enterprise-grade service even to small and mid-sized customers. Their dedication to efficiency, reliability, and customer satisfaction is unmatched.

I reported the IP's and they removed, which is good, but the spammers keep returning with new IP's (all from Hetzner). I kept reporting all IP's to them the entire month of June, and they kept banning the spammers who also kept returning then with other IP addresses. I'm tired... I'm seriously thinking about changing my email address because I'm tired of reporting spammers to Hetzner just to see they coming back again some days later. These spammers are using Hetzner IP address and sending messages trying to impersonate legitimate companies, such as Docusign with malware links (always hosted on Secureserver.net too). While I believe Hetzner did a good job banning the IP's I reported, I believe they are doing a bad job avoiding the spammers to come back and I'm tired of reporting, I'm not a Hetzner employee. These spammers have a pattern, their emails always come with cheap domains TLD such as (.cfd, .sbs, etc) and their emails always have a 'document01' on the from, but Hetzner can't do anything to block them. Edit 1: After my complaint to Trustpilot, the spam reduced a lot, I'd say it reduced in 90%, so I'll increase to 2 stars now, they seem to be finally blocking these spammers."

The company can be non-transparent but I am transparent. The reason is CGNAT pools. There aren't many ipv4 addresses left so ISPs will usually give several people the same IP address.

İsmail Ç,TR,"Updated Jun 12, 2025",1,Avoid Hetzner: Unresponsive Support and Unfair Billing,"While I was planning to purchase a dedicated server from Hetzner, I mistakenly selected a managed server through their system. I was unaware that their payment model worked on a ""use first, pay later"" basis. As soon as I realized the mistake, I attempted to cancel the setup and immediately sent an email to their support team explaining the situation in detail. Unfortunately, I received no response, and the server was automatically deployed. I canceled the service immediately after the setup was completed. About a month later, I received an invoice for €199.32 as a “setup fee” and was informed that the debt would be handed over to a collection agency if I didn’t pay. Despite clearly and repeatedly explaining the mistake, the support team showed no interest in addressing the issue. I was genuinely shocked by their indifferent, unhelpful, and customer-disregarding attitude. The responses I received were so automated and generic that it was difficult to tell whether they were written by a human or a bot — and frankly, it didn’t feel like anyone was actually listening. This experience made it clear to me that Hetzner cares far more about issuing invoices and collecting payments than about customer satisfaction. Their insistence on charging for a service I did not use, their refusal to halt the process despite timely warnings, and their complete lack of a solution-oriented approach reveal a lot about how they operate. Therefore, I strongly advise everyone: steer clear of Hetzner. Their service quality, support responsiveness, and approach to customer communication are seriously lacking."

Just immediate account termination. And when I asked them to reopen my account to fix the payment or at least recover my data, they refused. Their unprofessionalism cost my business real money.

John,CA,"Updated Jun 10, 2025",1,"North Americans if you care about your money, avoid Hetzner","I'm a tech industry veteran from North America with over 15 years of experience, and I’ve seen a lot. From cloud cost horror stories to billing mistakes that got resolved with a single support ticket. But my recent experience with Hetzner was so poor I felt the need to warn others. With major providers like AWS, Google, or Microsoft, billing misunderstandings are common. But those companies often waive questionable charges because they understand the long-term value of keeping a paying customer. A perfect example: a Vercel client had a $25K bill slashed down to a fraction after negotiating with them. I’ve personally seen companies get 5 and 6-figure cloud bills waived when it made sense because smart businesses know it pays off in the long run. Not Hetzner. Here’s what happened. I bought a small SaaS project and briefly took over the seller’s Hetzner account to get access to some environment variables. Turns out, the seller left their old servers running and Hetzner considered me the owner without any real notification. Weeks later, I found a bill in my spam folder. Less than $15. I contacted support right away and explained the situation. For context, I had an active Hetzner account paying around $50 per month. I politely asked if they could waive the old bill or, if not, let me pay it online. Their response? No waiving, no exceptions. And get this, the only way to pay the bill was with a wire transfer. That would cost me over $50 just to send a $15 payment that wasn’t even mine to begin with. Their only alternative? Debt collection. So I canceled everything with Hetzner, moved all my services to AWS, and closed my account. They can keep the $15. They just lost a $500 per year customer over an issue that most companies would have resolved in one email. If you're a North American company or anyone used to modern customer service, consider this a heads-up. Hetzner might seem cheap on paper, but when something goes wrong, you're on your own. No flexibility, no empathy, no basic online payment options in 2025. You get what you pay for. Editing my review since I got the generic response from Hetzner: I was in contact with Hetzner for a week. Their ""customer service"" team (if you can call it that) was nice enough to simply give me two options: wire or we start debt collection. So if you were looking for something cheap and had the bad luck of signing up with Hetzner - I urge you, transfer EVERYTHING out. Because at the first hiccup, you're on your own. The cheapness goes way beyond the servers and is probably what the company’s built on. Lastly, don’t take my word for it. Please go ahead and read the horror stories from REAL people in the comments - rude support, random deletion of accounts, blocking you from accessing your account, billing you after you canceled your account. If it’s a tech horror story, they have it in the worst way possible.... If you’re actually interested in setting up your company foundation or even a side hustle – avoid Hetzner like the plague..!"

Despite that, Hetzner blocked my console access and kept me locked out for weeks. Even worse; they continued to bill me for services I couldn’t use or manage in any way. This alone is unethical, but what shocked me most was the tone of their support team. Instead of assisting or showing any empathy, I was threatened with legal action in the end of conversation, i tried to manage situation with a soft approach. But support had no professional conduct, just threats. It's outrageous that a company would treat a paying customer this way.

These include small web hosting packages, domain registrations, and even a cloud server. I've always had excellent experiences with the technical support. Unfortunately, the support for domain-related issues leaves much to be desired. The staff there seem to be chronically overworked, responding only every three days with canned replies that lately haven’t been helpful at all. The responses from different support agents often contradict each other, which isn’t helpful either. In my case, I wanted to transfer a domain from one Hetzner account to another. The cancellation and transfer tools don’t allow for this. After a week of support emails, I was finally told that there’s apparently a PDF form I could print out and fax. According to one online support agent, I filled it out incorrectly — while a phone support agent told me it was completely correct. Nevertheless, I had to fill it out, sign it, stamp it, and fax it multiple times from various places. It strongly reminded me of the infamous permit from Asterix & Obelix. And Hetzner isn’t even a government agency. I don’t even want to imagine how much support cost Hetzner has now invested into this single case — which they certainly won’t recover anytime soon from a Level 1 hosting package for two euros a month. Finally it took more than four weeks all in all to move a domain inhouse from one account to another. My suggestion would be to make internal domain transfers possible using the registrar’s Auth-Codes and, most importantly, to increase support capacity for domain-related issues. As it stands, I no longer recognize the provider I once affectionately referred to as “my digital home.” Edit: I included ticket number, so your answer seems generated."

I submitted my driver’s license, only to receive an email days later saying my account was deleted because they didn’t accept the document. I gave it another try, this time using my passport. After a long wait, they asked for more verification. I completed their KYC process (passport + selfie), which clearly showed as verified. Yet, four business days later, my account is still stuck on “pending” with no communication from support. After checking online, I saw many others reporting similar issues — some even lost their data due to sudden account deletions. That was the final straw. I deleted my account and moved on. I’ve never had such a difficult onboarding experience — not even with free-tier services. Hetzner might offer competitive pricing, but the risk and support delays aren’t worth it. UPDATE: After Hetzner reply below, I can 100% deny their version of the story, there is no missing step and I’m sure they are just saying that.

Their response time is incredible – most requests are resolved within just a few hours. What really sets Hetzner apart is the excellent price-to-performance ratio. They offer extremely competitive rates without compromising on quality. Additionally, the ability to make all server configurations yourself without facing constant limitations or extra charges for every small adjustment is a major advantage.

To further confirm my identity, I also submitted my government-issued ID when requested. Despite all this, my account was still canceled. This was my first time using Hetzner, so there’s no reason my device should have been flagged or fingerprinted as suspicious. I understand the importance of fraud prevention and customer protection, I can't help but feel that Hetzner’s system may be aggressive or even discriminatory. Many of the negative reviews here point to the same issue: accounts being canceled with little explanation. From what I’ve seen, if you can make it through the verification process or avoid triggering their ridiculous automated checks the actual services seem solid. Thanks!"
Ed,LU,"May 5, 2025",1,Crap. Didn't bother to check who I'm.,Ordered service on 1st of May 2025. They asked me to upload scan of my passport. Used scan copy of one of my passports. No response. Today (5th of May) tried to login and system says account is disabled. They could ask linkedin profile for instance. Didn't bother. Not professional. Stay away.

Rob van Heijningen,NL,"Apr 28, 2025",5,I have been using Hetzner’s cloud…,"I have been using Hetzner’s cloud hosting services extensively and can confidently say they deliver exceptional performance combined with outstanding customer support. From the very beginning, the deployment of servers was incredibly fast, smooth, and reliable. The control panel is intuitive and allows for easy scaling of resources whenever needed. Their infrastructure provides excellent speed and uptime, critical for running professional applications and services without interruptions. What truly sets Hetzner apart, however, is their customer support. Whenever I had questions — whether technical or administrative — their support team responded quickly, clearly, and effectively. They demonstrate deep technical knowledge and genuine commitment to helping customers succeed. Issues are often resolved within minutes, not hours, which is rare in the hosting industry. In terms of price-performance ratio, Hetzner simply outperforms most competitors. You receive high-quality servers at a very affordable rate, with no hidden costs. Summary in points: • Extremely fast and reliable cloud hosting • Intuitive and powerful management interface • Responsive, knowledgeable, and friendly support team • Excellent uptime and performance stability • Best-in-class price-to-performance ratio If you are looking for a professional and dependable cloud hosting provider, I highly recommend Hetzner without hesitation!"
Bart,PL,"Apr 26, 2025",5,I really recommend it!,"I have been using Hetzner services for 8 years. Technical support responds quickly, during this period there were only three failures that affected my services for a dozen or so minutes. During this period I had dozens of VPSs, currently I have 8 of them, which work really well. I like the possibility of paying by the hour, when I want to test something or need an additional server for a few days. Servers are available within seconds of generating them in the panel or via API. I mainly use: VPS, volumes, private network. Soon I will probably expand with a dedicated server bought at hetzner auctions. I really recommend it!"

All of my data is completely genuine, complete and correct. If you see it as suspicious - the problem is you have broken security checks. Please verify the correctness of it because looks like you loosing your customers because of it. There are many ways to check my address (bills, another documents), my bank credentials. For some reason you just decide to bounce a customer because you see it as ""suspicious"", but not to provide ways to prove his identity.

Hayden Falzon,AU,"Apr 15, 2025",4,Great at getting the big picture right!,"Hetzner servers are not the best... not even close to the best. But they are good. Yes they are a little dated in hardware. But if there is one thing I can depend on Hetzner for it is their dependability! They get the little things right and it adds up to a fantastic service! I have actually yet to need any reason to contact support for anything (Aside from signing up and sending a few documents over) I would recommend Hetzner over a lot of other players for their VPS shared (Anywhere) and Dedicated Servers (In Europe). I have been using them for nearly a year now! And I am so happy that I have found them. They are great. Do your self a favour and before you use DO or VULTR (Which I aslo like) try out Hetzner. The reason I am writing this, is despite being great, I have been on the hunt for a different product line namely a dedicated VPS with specific specs (NVME and modern CPU (They have AMD Epyc 7x and 9x for their dedicated VPS offerings, but no option it seems to get which ever, seems like draw of the cards) and have only found a dredge of armatures when compared to Hetzner. So I wanted to let people know that this is a great island in the sea of mediocrity."

After I bought a service from Hetzner my account was instantly flagged as fraudulent (although I paid and did nothing wrong except using Linux and Firefox, that combo seems to trigger their shitty fraud prevention system). I just thought that they’ve banned my account. After some time I discovered that they continued to charge me (without sending ANY payments or overdue notification, since the account was, in fact, blocked) simple because I tried to contact them to find out why I was blocked and what could I do to restore my account (in order to try the service again). Not only did they not apologize for the disservice, but also asked me to pay the overdue payments of a service I was NEVER able to consume because of them."

When I sent my driving license, they rejected it and permanently disabled my account without any explanation. I followed up with their support, but they refused to reveal the reason behind the rejection. I suspect it might be because of my name. The morons handling the verification don’t seem to understand that different cultures have different naming conventions, and the names on official documents might not appear in the same order. They’re rejecting accounts as if we’re trying to use their service for free. Ridiculous. Therefore, I decided to switch to Vultr. Vultr offers the same affordable pricing while maintaining quality and providing a lot of location and services options. Bandwidth is the only drawback.

Lakshay Behl,US,"Apr 4, 2025",1,Not for actual real world businesses,"1-Star Review – Do not waste your time with Hetzner if you’re an actual business owner Hetzner might offer good infrastructure — but their automated identity system is absolutely broken and built with zero regard for real-world entrepreneurs. I was asked to verify my ID not because I failed anything, but because their system auto-flagged me for using a U.S. billing address. I’m a non-U.S. person operating a U.S. entity, which is a completely valid global business scenario. They prefilled “United States” and offered no option to change it. Then they rejected my identity document based on the country they forced me into. To top it off, their system won’t let you change payment method unless you pass ID verification — and PayPal isn’t even supported in many countries. So the flow is: • You can’t pay unless verified • You can’t verify unless your ID matches the wrong country • You can’t change the country • You can’t reach a human It’s Kafka with a logo. I wasted 20 minutes and got nothing. I moved to Vultr instead and was live in 5. Hetzner might be good for hobby devs in Germany, but if you’re a global business building real infrastructure, stay away. They don’t deserve your attention or your money."

After that, I didn't want to deal with messy interface, I sent a very very clear email that I want to cancel my subscription on a certain date. Usually this kind of email is enough for many service providers, however it wasn't enough for Hetzner. They sent me an email, which i thought of an automated response, that I can cancel my subscription myself. I thought my willingness and clear email should suffice and didn't check the response mail anymore. After a month, I received another invoice and customer support says one email wasn't enough to cancel, I should have sent the second email to confirm my first cancelation request. It doesn't make any sense! Eventually they cancelled my subscription (obviously cancellation via email was possible) but they require me to pay the past month for unused server. Truly disappointed!"

I contacted them multiple times via email and phone, requesting access to my backups or a temporary reactivation so I could migrate my data, but they refused to cooperate. Hetzner's actions have caused me severe financial damage, and their customer support has been unhelpful and unresponsive. If you rely on your data, be VERY careful with Hetzner! I have now filed a GDPR complaint against them for refusing to provide access to my personal data. Think twice before trusting Hetzner with your business!"
Rafael Gras,US,"Mar 26, 2025",1,They are paranoid,"I recently signed up for Hetzner's online services, and my experience has been nothing short of frustrating. To start, I provided all the necessary information, including my credit card details and, also I found it rare..., I understood that my account was pending approval. I decided finally go for it, and as part of the process, I had to submit a picture of my passport to verify my identity. While I was aware that the review process wasn’t automatic, I waited patiently, trusting that everything would be handled smoothly. Despite having read complaints about their services, I decided to take the risk because their pricing was competitive. Unfortunately, that risk did not pay off. The following day, I received an email from Hetzner with my login credentials and instructions to access their platform. I was relieved, thinking everything had been resolved. However, just a few hours later, I received another email stating that my account had been deactivated due to “concerns” with my information. Along with this, they canceled all my existing products and orders. Just like that: ""Dear **** After reviewing your updated customer information, we have decided to deactivate your account because of some concerns we have regarding this information. Therefore, we have cancelled all your existing products and orders with us. Best regards Your Hetzner Online Team"" To my surprise and dismay, there was no clear explanation or reasoning provided for this decision. I had submitted all the required information, had done nothing wrong, and yet, my account was abruptly terminated. This lack of transparency and accountability left me feeling incredibly frustrated and, frankly, disrespected. Not only did this experience waste my precious time, but it also made me regret trusting Hetzner in the first place. A company that handles sensitive customer information should at least have the courtesy to explain their decisions, especially when they affect their customers directly. Overall, I would not recommend Hetzner to anyone seeking reliable and professional online services."

I have personally had, quite literally, a flawless experience with Hetzner. Been hosting with them for 8 months, their prices are great, I never had a second of downtime, performance is great, latency is great, data throughput is great, it's just perfect for someone like me. I also really like their ""cloud boxes"" which I use for remote development since my PC can struggle running 3 different dev environments together, and it's been really easy to set them up, wipe their data, get new ones, remove old ones. BUT, I also know by second hand experience that getting in, can be a problem. I had people I know do the exact same as me and get their account flagged. It's a pain when it does happen. And they are very adamant on being as non-transparent on these issues, which is something that does not sit right with me. It's security from obfuscation.

The delays were more than 3 seconds on one server in the chain (spine15.cloud2.fsn1.hetzner.com)!!! I tried to change the network settings on my server, but every time it resulted in an out-of-service error and a problem logging in through SSH (due to very strange network settings). Hetzner support responded with significant delays (after many days...)! And the advice was always the same - go to the forum. But do not hope for help there either.

Instead I got my account blocked. I have been working online for 10 years, I never hide my identity and I am ready to go through any verification, I buy different services, hostings, domains, software, but hetzner the smartest ones considered me a scammer and of course they ""can't be wrong"". Okay. Be careful! My recommendation to those who, like me, have been victimised by hetzner and had your account blocked for no reason. Look for servers by processor from other companies, just search on google for example ‘amd ryzen 9 dedicated server’ and you will find many companies with good prices and configurations. Hetzner are not the only ones on the market and with them you can't be sure that at any moment your account won't be locked for no reason.

I was also excited to finally work with Hetzner, a company I'd seen recommended in various venues many times. If you're coming from other providers, Hetzner does have some peculiarities compared to most other hosting providers. (e.g. no direct KVM access to your servers, 3 hour time limits for temporary KVM access) But, there's also a lot of good and things are well automated where most things I'd need or want are easily available to me.

The prices are great, the performance is solid, and the network speed is impressive. I’ve never had issues with uptime or reliability, which is why I’ve stuck with them. But recently, I’ve run into a serious problem. I can’t order any new services—I’m only allowed to keep using the ones I already have. This really affects my ability to scale, which was one of the main benefits of choosing Hetzner. I’ve contacted support multiple times, and each time I’ve been given unclear or unhelpful responses and brushed off. I’ve tried to cooperate and find a solution, but it feels like I’m being simply ignored. It’s frustrating and honestly disappointing because I expected better from a company like Hetzner. I really hope someone from Hetzner can reach out and help resolve this. I’d like to see this issue fixed so I can continue fully benefiting from their services, and I also hope Hetzner can improve their support, as it would lead to better customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately benefiting the company in the long run. Update: Since writing this review, the situation has only worsened. Hetzner has informed me that the restriction on my account will not be lifted, no longer allowed to order new services. This decision was made without providing any clear reason or explanation, despite my repeated attempts to cooperate and resolve the issue all my classifications nd questions were ignored and all I got was an two line response brushing me off. To add to the frustration, I’ve recently experienced server faults, which have further highlighted the lack of support and cooperation from Hetzner. Their refusal to work with me or even clarify the reasons for the restriction has left me with no choice but to migrate my services elsewhere. I am deeply disappointed in Hetzner’s handling of this situation. Their lack of transparency, unhelpful support, and unwillingness to collaborate with a long-term customer have completely ruined my trust in their services. I regret putting my trust in Hetzner in the first place and wish they had been more cooperative in helping me resolve this mess. This experience has been a stark reminder of how important it is for companies to value their customers and work with them to solve problems. Unfortunately, Hetzner has failed in this regard."

Navigating through it feels effortless, and it makes managing resources straightforward and even enjoyable. That said, exploring other sections like the dedicated servers and account settings has been a bit of an adjustment, as they don’t share the same polished feel as the Cloud UI.

I’ve never found another provider that comes even close. Everything—pricing, service quality, network reliability, and support—has been consistently great. It’s been a smooth experience overall, and I’m genuinely happy working with them. As for the negative reviews, I think there’s usually a reason or explanation behind them, but my personal experience has been nothing but positive."

As my project scaled, I needed additional powerful servers, so I decided to request a limit increase. After my first attempt, support denied my request. I then decided to request fewer vCPUs than before, but this time my account was blocked. When I saw the email, I was shocked and confused. Does Hetzner really treat clients needing additional resources with such skepticism? You be the judge. I haven’t encountered this kind of issue with Hetzner’s competitors.

Over the past year, we have paid over 1,000 Euros for your services and relied on Hetzner for our company's infrastructure. However, without any prior notice or valid explanation, our account was suddenly suspended, causing significant disruption to our operations. This lack of communication and the abrupt suspension of our services has severely impacted our business, and we are now facing considerable difficulties as a result. Given this experience, we no longer feel confident in Hetzner's ability to support its customers properly. As a result, we are advising our partners and clients to avoid using Hetzner services moving forward, as it is clear that customer concerns are not given the attention they deserve. We request an immediate explanation regarding this matter, as well as a resolution to the issues caused by this suspension. Vecima"

Endre,NO,"Nov 19, 2024",3,"Mostly great, sometimes bad..","Been with Hetzner for more than 12 years now, with several dedicated and virtual servers, Nextcloud and storage boxes. There has been little to no downtime, probably just an hour or two in total for twelve full years (with the exception of a few, planned maintenance periods that we were notified about in advance). Prices has increased, though, and the reason isn't always logical. For instance, a couple of years ago, prices for IP subnets increased dramatically. They pointed at IP shortage, and that they had to recover the added costs for aquiring additional subnets for new clients. I don't really understand why loyal customers are responsible for financing new subnets for new customers. Yes, I do understand how businesses work, but this was a bad move. I have since moved some of my dedicated and virtual servers to one of their biggest competitors. In all fairness though, Hetzner has a much better infrastructure, and better services overall. I will probably cancel my last dedicated server in a few months, but I will keep some cloud servers, my Nextcloud account and a storage box. One thing I've hated since day one though, is their KVM remote console service. It's about time those Lantronix spiders were put to rest. The first 7-8 years I subscribed to a permanent remote console, to be absolutely sure that I would be able to reach the server whenever I needed to, without contacting Hetzner. However, that console was unavailable each and every time had to use it. Not even a single time was it up and running, so I had to ask Hetzner for a reset anyway. And even then, it would probably just be working for a little time (typically from 10 minutes to a couple of hours), then it would die on me again. I've experienced the same issues with on-demand remote console from Hetzner. Don't waste your money on a permanent remote console. And if you really need it, you should probably look elsewhere. All things considered, I have no problem recommending Hetzner, albeit with some reservations. Take account of sudden price increases and the fact that you may not always be able to reach the console on your dedicated servers on short notice."

Joub,FR,"Nov 8, 2024",1,Avoid Hetzner – Unjust Charges and GDPR Concerns,"I've used many web hosting providers, but Hetzner has been by far the worst experience. I activated a service but quickly found the interface far too complicated for my skill level. Because of this, I didn't install or use anything on the service and canceled it just a few hours later. Despite my clear explanations to their support team that I never used the service, Hetzner refused to issue a refund and instead sent additional, seemingly unjustified invoices. I understand that setup fees are non-refundable, but nothing justifies being charged month after month for an unused, canceled service. Their responses felt automated and showed no evidence that anyone actually read or engaged with my support emails. To make matters worse, when I requested GDPR-compliant data deletion, they simply told me to delete my account myself,but stated I couldn’t do so because more invoices were expected. This refusal to comply with GDPR requirements further trapped me in a cycle of unjustified charges and account restrictions. Hetzner's opaque policies, lack of transparency, and disregard for GDPR compliance make for a highly frustrating and concerning experience. If you're looking for a provider with fair billing, a user-friendly interface, and responsive support, I strongly advise looking elsewhere."

Dennis Doso,IT,"Oct 30, 2024",3,My opinions regarding Hetzner are…,"My opinions regarding Hetzner are conflicting, let me explain. I appreciate the fact that if I delete a server before 15 days, I don't pay a single cent for it and I have never abused this thing but I admit that every now and then, I kept a server or two for a short time specifically to not pay for it, but over to this... the price for the quality of the hardware is very convenient and competitive and I really appreciate it, but the technical support only responds to you when and if it wants to do so, I never understood what that notification email from the German federation is , I asked for explanations but no one ever answered me, so I simply ignored that warning for over 2 years, it continues to arrive every month but I no longer care and I continually ignore it, it's a real shame that they don't offer dedicated servers located in the USA because they would be really useful for my business, in my opinion Hetzner is the best provider of dedicated servers in Europe and I continue to use a server in Germany but for the server in the US I had to try another provider and I can say that I am better off with the one there instead of Hetzner, I think i will also be moving Hetzner's German server to the new provider so as to pay only one invoice per month instead of two on two different sites"
Eric,NL,"Oct 29, 2024",1,Missed an invoice of €8.14: everything deleted and banned as customer!,"Due to being on vacation, I missed an invoice from Hetzner. As a result, my servers and account were deactivated, after which I immediately paid the invoice. However, it turned out that my account had already been completely deleted, and according to Hetzner, the only option was to create a new account and set up and configure the servers again. I found this quite bizarre, especially since it was an invoice for only €8.14! On the other hand I realized it was my own mistake, so I decided to create a new account, which then had to be manually reviewed and activated. After a few hours, I received a message saying: ""After reviewing your updated customer information, we have decided to deactivate your account because of some concerns we have regarding this information."" So, because I missed an €8.14 invoice, it seems I can never be a customer at Hetzner again. Fortunately, there are plenty of great alternatives out there. On the other hand, it's a shame because I was actually satisfied with Hetzner's services."

After a simple restart it turns out all of my hostkeys and password have been refreshed. I found this out after being unable to log in another 50 times, cancelling the server out of frustration and AFTER THAT receiving an email about how Ubuntu is installed after the restart and my credentials are refreshed. Just be wary. If you think you have any idea what's going on in your server - you don't. You just do stuff and hopefully it works, if it does or doesn't, you'll probably receive an email 90 minutes after the fact. Ffs, I didn't even have a ""server is online"" indicator...

Every server I create in their Germany location is limited to just two IP ranges: 91.x.x.x and 5.x.x.x. This restriction has caused serious problems for my project, including scalability issues and concerns about IP blocking, since these ranges are frequently overused. Despite multiple attempts to resolve this through Hetzner's email support, nothing has changed. It's frustrating that a hosting provider as large as Hetzner hasn’t addressed such a basic issue that is essential for large-scale hosting projects. The lack of diverse IP allocation in Germany significantly limits my business’s growth, and I hope they resolve this soon or I might have to look for other hosting options. If you're running a project that relies on diverse IP ranges, keep this in mind before choosing Hetzner’s Germany servers."

Edit: couple of days after the initial review, I got the response from Hetzner that my data will be deleted automatically ""after"" 14 days. Assuming they are true to their word, it's not anymore a major privacy issue. Still, it was a bitter experience. I have services from Google and Linode and tested a few other providers during the time I signed up to Hetzner too, none had such intrusive checks (well, except Google that knows me better than myself...) and they were mostly transparent on their practices.

They did this without any prior warning or notification, which prevented me from backing up the data I have on the servers. I have also contacted support via phone and email but received no response, except for an automated email. It is truly disappointing, and it's unexpected from such a large and experienced data center like Hetzner to suddenly block everything without providing enough time or opportunity for backup, and without offering any response. I have not received any response, email, or call from you. Please guide me on how to resolve this issue and have my account reactivated. If there is anything I need to do, kindly let me know. Thank you for your follow-up. Hetzner account K0701026724 Please look into this matter. Thank you."
Андрей Павлов,NL,"Sep 17, 2024",1,Account Banned WITHOUT ANY REASON – Outrageous!,"I'm beyond furious right now! I woke up yesterday to an email from Hetzner informing me that my account had been banned, even though I’ve paid every single invoice on time. NO WARNING, NO EXPLANATION – just BAM, account gone! To make matters worse, ALL of my data was wiped out without a single heads-up, and my services were down for hours. Everything I’ve worked on, GONE. How is this even acceptable?! You can't just pull the plug on people like this with zero communication or justification. In the same email where they told me my account was banned, they also said that I have no way to communicate with them and they wouldn’t tell me the reason! At the very least, give us a REASON and some time to react. I’ve lost everything because of this. Unbelievable!"

We cannot provide any information on individual cases. Thank you for your understanding. Kind regards Customer Data analytics"" But actually what I did was this: After registering for the lowest arm64 package to experience, I installed Flashpanel to manage the server, connecting via API account hetzner. and during the panel installation process, in the arm64 registration package option, I mistakenly selected arm86, so the installation process automatically registered a new cloud in my account, and then I deleted it. If that's the reason for them to ban my account, it's not satisfactory. I sent support to them but haven't received a reply. That was normal for all the other providers I used, but they didn't notify me in advance, just sent me an email terminating the service immediately. That made me feel disrespected.

As I mentioned before, dudes from hetzner welcome any malicious activity, but not legitimate business. Today my resource was subjected to massive DDoS attack using hetzner ASN. Dudes in their abuse report form suggest sending more than 60 thousand IP addresses ""separately"" one at a time.

There are tons of reasons why hetzner is an excellent ISP for me, so this only the very core of reasons: * Easy API to create servers by script * Self managed packet-firewall with groups of rules to assign to all servers I like * strong virtual machines * easy adding of storage and resize that storage via Webinterface. * Free to choose where to locate the servers in Europe: Nuernberg, Falkenstein, Helsinki. Other places like US, Singapore etc are there (not interesting for my business though) * Creating own virtual private networks between my servers * Easy to setup backup-storage for restic, borg with a product called Storagebox which is sizeable 1TB start up to 20 TBytes!!!!

As a web developer managing multiple servers, I’m always looking for a balance between cost and performance, and Hetzner delivers on both fronts. Their pricing is incredibly competitive, offering great value for the level of performance and reliability they provide. I’m also thrilled that they now have a US location for their servers, which has improved performance for my clients in North America. I was so impressed with Hetzner that I convinced one of my clients to switch their hosting to Hetzner as well, and they’ve been equally satisfied with the move. Overall, Hetzner is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for affordable, reliable hosting solutions with a growing global presence."

As a self-proclaimed female geek, I’ve had my fair share of tech support nightmares—but Hetzner? They’re in a league of their own! From the very start, Camillo Heller helped me choose the perfect web hosting plan, making sure it fit my needs like a glove. Then, when it came to navigating the tangled web of DNS settings, Jan Venzke was an absolute legend, guiding me through it all with ease (and a lot of patience!). And just when I thought I might hit a snag, Patrick Reichart swooped in with crystal-clear instructions on how to redirect a domain—so simple, even my cat could follow along (though she was too busy napping, but you get the idea!). The best part? They made everything so easy that I almost felt like a DNS wizard myself by the end of it! The whole process was smoother than a well-brewed cup of coffee. If you’re looking for top-notch support with a whole lot of expertise, look no further than Hetzner. Five stars simply aren’t enough—these folks deserve a galaxy of them! Cheers to the Hetzner team, and a special shoutout to Camillo Heller, Jan Venzke, and Patrick Reichart for being absolute stars! 🌟"

I'm a small customer, learning wordpress and backend ops, so I really appreciate their strict attitude to security and procedures.

I've tried Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode, OVH, and AWS, and honestly, Hetzner holds its own against them. Sure, for some specific cases, AWS can be handy—especially if you need a complex infrastructure—or Vultr if you're looking for a specific location. But Hetzner has servers in the US, Germany, and recently Singapore, which is more than enough given their unbeatable pricing. Lately, I've been really digging their ARM Cloud machines; they've helped me cut down the costs of running websites a lot!"
Giuseppe P,GB,"Aug 20, 2024",5,"Yes, they are strict, but you won't find anything better","I have been using Hetzner for around 10 years and currently manage a few dozen of their root servers (and a few website). In terms of value for money, it's hard to find anything better. Their hardware is solid and their support is fast enough, as I always got the first reply within ~20m for server issues. Yes, they are strict with their rules, so if you want to enjoy their services, you need to be diligent: pay on time, avoid network abuses, and be prepared to provide any requested documents when asked. I've heard horrible stories about clients being shut down overnight, but when I took a look deeper (by reading on forums, etc), I found out the client was very fishy. Moreover I see that many 1-star reviews come from those whose account openings were rejected. I believe this should not be taken into account when evaluating the service, as Hetzner prefers not to do business with everyone. There are plenty of abusers they prefer to stay away from, and sometimes they might even reject legitimate users by mistake. I've had servers locked a few times, and on most occasions, it was my fault. When it wasn't, I reported the issue to a supervisor who addressed it. Remember, they are (still) human employees and can make mistakes. For now, I'm a satisfied customer, and I hope I won't have to regret this review in the future :D"

Refuse to explain the Charges. Refuse to even respond to a ticket. Then they proceed to shut off one of the domains. We are reasonable people and just wanted them to explain how the bill was so high for 30 days and now the wont even respond. The are holding our domains hostage and shut one off. Them shutting this domain off is a loss of potential income. If you want a good and fair company this is not the one for you. Save yourself a hassle.

Tanja Vigdisdottir,SE,"Updated Aug 14, 2024",4,Lea saves the day,"I signed up for Hetzner as it came recommended by a colleague. I was notified during the registration process that according to Hetzner automated systems my account carried for unknown reason increased risk and a verification was required. I tried with my drivers license and it failed. I tried with my passport and it failed to. It seems the id verification company Hetzner uses is negatively biased against minorities which is not a surprise given Hetzner is a german company and Germany has a well documented history on their stance on minorities. I inmediatly created a support ticket in the portal requesting a GDPR SAR as I want to know what information Hetzner has on me but the ticket disappeared from the portal. I sent an email on Hetzner support but did not get any response. I even sent an email on the data protection officer at Hetzner, Alena Scholtz but have got no reply. This silence and the strangely faulty id verification process makes me worried about the integrity of the private information I have sent to Hetzner. Will Hetzner leak my highly sensitive id data and is it kept safe? In any case, Hetzner has 30 days to comply with my GDPR SAR request according to EU laws and in case of non compliance Ill certainly report Hetzner to the relevant authorities in Germany which in worst case will lead to an audit and possibly hefty fines and faceloss. Update I have received a confirmation for my SAR which is good. Now the 30 days are ticking and I expect Hetzner to comply with my request. The account has been verifed and the support team notes the problems were to a blurry image. That in itself is a valid point but begs the question about the software being used and the fact that the warning a human intervention takes 1 - 5 minutes is worthless as the reality is very different. The support team had the nerve to ask me to change my review which I find insulting. I am writing about a real experience in this review and it reflects what actually occured. The inital experience was horrible and that needs to be noted. That the company picks up on it through the review is positive but it begs the question about Hetzner support team. The online silence coupled with the support phone redirecting the customer to write an email points to problems with the support team which is not reassuring. I had to phone Hetzner in Finland to get any response and the very nice lady there relayed a message to Alena Scholtz to call me but she never did. Im thankful to Lea here on Trustpilot for acting swiftly and get things in order. Cudos to her but at the same time it feels strange a functioning customer support needs to go through Trustpilot instead of the designated support channels. Four stars on Trustpilot for Lea and her good work and change in subject header to reflect the new situation."

My goal was to bring my four e-commerce sites, running on CS-Cart, closer to my European customer base to optimize data transfer times. This search was not easy. For five years, while still hosting with Pair Networks, I tested a multitude of European hosts, looking for a service quality comparable to that of Pair Networks. It was finally Hetzner that stood out as the only one able to play in the same league. After this extensive search, in 2017, I closed my account with Pair Networks and transferred all my sites to a dedicated server at Hetzner. The experience has been remarkable ever since. The reliability, performance, and technical support have met my highest expectations. In fact, with my 24 years of experience in the field, I can confidently say that Hetzner's service quality surpasses that of all other hosts I've tested. Hetzner combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of e-commerce business needs. Their robust infrastructure ensures fast loading times and near-constant availability, crucial factors for the success of my online retail sites. For any European company looking for a world-class web host, I wholeheartedly recommend Hetzner.

I have been repeatedly impressed with the quality of their self-serve web interface where I can set up almost anything I need including networking, firewalls, billing and more. Their prices are absolutely the best. I initially found Hetzner by doing price research and comparisons for offline backup storage. Their Vault product was absolutely within my budget and my home Synology NAS has been getting backed up with them for months now. For my Cloud instances, I'm using their America/Virginia datacenter. In addition, I have found their support to be top notch. They reply pretty fast, and don't give me a lot of grief over my questions. Most things I've found in their excellent docs, though. They offer both Windows and Linux. I definitely recommend Hetzner to anyone looking for VPS, Cloud or offline backup storage. I sent them a thank you email along these lines and they suggested I let others know how I feel with a review. Good idea! I think the negative reviews you see here have to be spammers and abusers. They DO ask for ID (criminals won't want to provide that and to privacy fanatics I say: there is no privacy anymore). You have to pay at least one invoice before they'll open any mail ports (this makes it a bad numbers game for scammers and spammers). Before you leave a negative review, ask yourself what you did. Don't just punish the biz with a bad review because they didn't play your stupid spam/scam/criminal games."

Островський Олександр,UA,"Jul 3, 2024",2,Artificial restrictions and deception,"Internet channels and servers here are quite powerful, but artificial restrictions and deception nullify these advantages. Nowhere is it stated that the hosting has a limit on the number of files. That is, there may be plenty of space on the disk, but if there are many small files, they say to delete them. To change the main domain on the hosting, you have to order it again, and accordingly pay money for it. A bunch of ports, including the standard one for sending mail, are blocked. Support works very slowly. You can wait a couple of days for an answer."

The price is 4 times lower than DigitalOcean and 10 times lower than AWS. I haven't encountered any problems, there were a couple of downtimes due to network issues, lasting 2-3 hours per year."

Adrian,RO,"Jun 29, 2024",4,They are a nice company but a bit too sensitive,"They are a nice company but a bit too sensitive in certain situations. Prices are fair in my opinion, services are reliable, performance is very good for the price. For average user with common needs, it will be perfect. Problem is that they are too sensitive regarding certain things, if you have a search engine and you crawl from a hetzner VPS, it will be terminated. If someone makes a complaint (legit or not) you will be asked to comply to random people's requests, if not, your servers will be terminated and you also risk for your contact details be shared with sketchy parties that initated the complaints. Just one example, on one of my sites I list domains (like a directory), no copyrigted text / titles or content; Random people come and ask me to delist ""their"" url without wanting to verify that they are indeed the owner (by file upload or meta tag) and Hetzner asks me to comply to these. Somehow understandable because nobody wants to spend time and resources mediating disputes, but it would be refreshing to see a web hosting company that allows freedom of speech (in legal limits) instead of avoiding any inconvenience at the expense of the clients. Sending client details to the people that initiate complaints is also not OK, unless it has a legal ground (court order, etc), because on one ocasion (similar to above situation) I had someone telling me that he will find me and ""finish"" me, unless I alter the content of my site based on his request. He had my contact details after he made an abusive DMCA claim without any grounds. The internet has become a nasty place and laws are only in place to protect corporations (DMCA, etc)."

I created an account about a week ago, and upon logging into my account, it asked me to verify my identity, and I uploaded my ID card photo, and after 24 hours, my request was rejected for no reason!!!! . This time, I applied with another email with my wife's identification documents. I applied again, which was rejected again. I asked them for an explanation and I said them (Is our European passport not enough for you)? They replied that I should create a user account with an organizational email to be approved. I spent a lot of time and money and created a domain in Namevheap and then created an organizational email and this time I put 2 European passports for confirmation. Guess what happened? Was rejected ? And now this is how I know Hetzner, a ridiculous company with illogical, unplanned customer management, people full of motivation to annoy others and.... I am the manager of several Facebook groups of over 20,000 people in Scandinavia. I will share my bitter and ridiculous experience with the members of my groups and I will try my best not to let anyone buy any service from this company with this stupid behavior.I know that maybe one of them will come and give me an answer under my comment that (..Dear, we understand you and we are sorry for your bad experience, but we prefer not to state our reasons to avoid possible abuses) and this explanation They are the most absurd and ridiculous of all. They have not yet understood the world of communication"
André,PT,"Jun 18, 2024",1,Account Locked Without Clear Explanation,"I have been using Hetzner as my hosting provider, relying on their services for my projects. Recently, however, I encountered an issue that has made me question the transparency and customer support approach of the company. Without prior notice, Hetzner locked my account from making new orders following a routine check, citing unspecified red flags related to system policy violations, abuse complaints, IPs with bad reputations, and/or incorrect account data. They've informed me that I can continue to use my existing services but barred me from adding new ones for at least one month. After contacting support via the automated 'Robot' system, I was informed via email that my account had been blocked due to hosting three VPS for websites under development, which contained 404 errors and dummy data—common occurrences for sites in development. It's perplexing that developmental errors or issues are deemed problematic by Hetzner, especially since my site does not discuss these internally, nor are they relevant to the external operations. In an effort to resolve this issue proactively, I proposed to delete the server until the development is complete, demonstrating my willingness to cooperate and ensure compliance. This approach feels unnecessarily aggressive and non-collaborative, also the support team at email / phone are extremely agressive. I'm prepared to provide a full explanation of my project and submit any required documentation to clear up any misunderstandings. However, the support's approach, which I perceive as authoritarian, has made it difficult to engage in a constructive dialogue. Trust is crucial in business relationships, and I am committed to maintaining transparency and integrity in my dealings. I hope Hetzner will reciprocate this and offer a more cooperative resolution pathway. Accusing clients of scamming without substantive evidence also seems detrimental to your business's reputation."
gyuriX,SK,"Updated Jun 18, 2024",1,Too much traffic usage causes bans,"Hetzner blocks accounts with too much traffic usage. They offer unlimited traffic, but if you use too much of it, then they will ban you from using their services without even asking you to reduce your usage or telling you that they banned you because of that. This is a very bad business practice, and they should instead set clear limits, to avoid confusing people. Hetzner, please reply to this review with the actual traffic limit you have. What's the amount what won't get people banned let's say for auction servers bellow 40 EUR price? If someone wants to make a total of 1 PB outgoing traffic monthly, how many auction servers are needed for that to prevent getting banned? Reply to your reply: You ended your email with a sentence including this: ""this decision is final and cannot be appealed"". Why is that? Why can't you be more specific regarding what's the issue, so we could solve the issue instead of flat out scheduling account closure to end of July and guessing the issue was related to having too much outgoing traffic, after talking to your resellers. This makes no sense. They told me that 2 weeks ago you had a wave of bans, suspending a bunch of people for high traffic usage and now all those customers are coming to them and other providers."

Regarding their dedicated servers line, I managed to satisfy all my clients needs with it. My company went from providing small IT services to full-fledged SaaS solutions. This success would haven't been possible without the reliability of their underlying infrastructure and the competitive pricing mode for its dedicated servers. I have also used other service providers over the years but none of them has come close to the quality/price ratio offered by Hetzner. I have also deployed some machines within their cloud offering, and I find it very competitive although I was expecting them to roll out more services following the AWS model. I'm currently in the process of testing their Terraform provider to convert part of my infrastructure to IaC. I will likely update this review once I have enough information to talk about it."

After encountering difficulties configuring IP addresses on my hosted server, I contacted their technical support for help. Unfortunately, instead of effectively solving my problem, I was met with dry responses and a total lack of assistance in resolving my situation. I ordered additional IP addresses, however, I had taken the wrong ones. Their support responded very quickly, and invited me to cancel the IPs and order new ones. I paid a €41.88 activation fee for 10-15 minutes of ""use"". They wouldn't refund the fee so I could take the good ones and pay the new activation fee. This attitude is simply unacceptable and shows a blatant lack of consideration for customer satisfaction. If they want to turn off new customers as soon as they arrive, that's their problem, but it's not a commercial way of doing things. It just drives the customer away, and that's my case. I strongly advise against doing business with Hetzner if you're looking for quality customer service and a fair sales policy. Sure, they have more or less attractive prices, but their lack of transparency and inability to resolve problems satisfactorily are alarming signs for anyone considering becoming a customer. I am deeply disappointed by this experience and would not recommend Hetzner to anyone."

Their hardware is indeed impressive and flawlessly handles high loads, which is a big plus for any business. However, our experience with account management left much to be desired. We recently encountered an unexpected closure of our account due to detected discrepancies, which came as a complete surprise to us. We apologize if we inadvertently violated any rules, although we carefully reviewed all the requirements before registration. We would like to emphasize that all the data we provided is authentic, which can be confirmed through our VAT ID. We highly value transparency and openness in any relationship and would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss and resolve this situation. Despite what happened, we still consider Hetzner one of the market leaders in terms of the quality of services provided and hope for a positive resolution of our issue."

Philip Fjærå,DK,"Mar 13, 2024",2,Poor DDOS protection and support at critical times.,"I've been a satisfied Hetzner customer for quite a long time. However, to truly judge a company you have to see how to react in case of issues rather than when everything is going smoothly. Unfortunately I've been targeted by DDOS attacks that quite seriously affect my business. Hetzner advertises their DDOS protection with following statement: ""We are also able to flexibly adapt to other unique attacks and to reliably mitigate them. The above technologies support a high level of automation, which our technicians continually optimize step by step. We can improve the system by analyzing each attack and constantly adjusting our filters and responses."" However, this is simply not true. I've been DDOSed almost a month now on various servers and there are no indication that Hetzner has any kind of interest in working with the client to improve their mitigation. Pretty much after a lengthy dialogue their response is ""Go and buy external DDOS protection. We do not offer this kind of support."" I am admitedly quite shocked with support on these issues has Hetzner in general seems competent and has offered great support. When I am truly in need, there is no help to be gotten here. I have over 40 dedicated servers spending well over €6000/month on their services. So beware, Hetzner is not willing to help mitigate a simple 100K pps volumetric DDOS attack that most other providers would have no issues dealing with normally. The biggest shocker is that their mitigation CAN mitigate it, but they refuse to enable the mitigation because it does not meet their threshold, even though they in the past has done this so the capability is there..."

Their server isn't just high-performing; it's also incredibly stable, which is crucial for my online projects and applications. What really sets Hetzner apart, in my opinion, is their customer support. Every time I've needed assistance or had queries, their team has been prompt, professional, and exceedingly helpful. It's reassuring to know that I have such responsive support to rely on whenever necessary. Moreover, the value for money is exceptional. The pricing is competitive, and considering the quality of service and server reliability, I find it to be an excellent investment. Hetzner also offers great flexibility in terms of server configurations, allowing me to tailor resources to suit my project needs perfectly.

After reading Mehmet Varcin's comment below, I felt the need to make this edit in my own comment because the comment below mentions that Hetzner's quality is not reflected in the rating on Trustpilot and that this is surprising. Hetzner will of course determine its customer policy itself. However, if there is a deficiency in the documents submitted for the membership process or a nonconformity that is later detected, it can be notified by e-mail and additional documents or verifications can be requested. Instead of doing this, accusing people of inappropriate behavior and canceling their membership causes customers who trust Hetzner to lose money, effort, time and trust. Hetzner states that it does this very intensively and in order to protect the rights of its other customers. They are outraged that the loss of customers is being ignored by canceling memberships immediately. This is reflected in the comments on Trustpilot. Epilogue A membership to be reactivated should not be canceled so easily."

Given my overwhelmingly positive experience, I find it surprising that Hetzner's reviews on Trustpilot do not fully reflect the high quality of service they provide.

Nikola,BG,"Updated Feb 14, 2024",1,Awful registration process - rejected,"I was searching for a hosting provider. I decided to try with Hetzner. Let me talk about their registration process: 1. During the process I was immediately asked for payment verification via CC or SEPA wire. Other providers also require this, so I guess it is OK. 2. Cannot use VPN during the registration. You will be able to register and go through the Name/address/phone and then CC payment and all only then to receive instant ""We decided to close your account"" in your mail. No mention of VPN usage, you have to figure that on your own. At least block the access to the website if using VPN, why are you wasting time? 3. After figuring out I should not use VPN and finally go about with your registration, then I needed to supply government-issued ID or passport. You cannot use your account before doing so. BTW, I am from an EU country, not really sure how that's considered a high risk. I provided the needed material. 4. Ultimately after 12 hours my registration was denied. No reason stated again, nothing blurry, nada. Nice, I had to provide more KYC information than most online banking institutions would require, mind you - for a HOSTING PROVIDER, and still get rejected. I do not recommend wasting time with them. Edit 07.02.24 - 3 workdays later, still no response from the support team. Only have received the automatic 'ticket received' response.

Without warning or clear explanation, my business account was closed, causing significant problems for my business. I was left without important resources and support. Although I am willing to attest to the accuracy of all information provided, Hetzner chose to close my account without giving me a chance to clarify the situation. Furthermore, my attempts to contact technical support have gone unanswered and unhelpful, which has only made the situation worse. I urge Hetzner to improve customer service and provide more open and honest communication. The approach to handling customer inquiries and concerns needs to be more responsive and attentive, especially when it affects customers' business. My account ID:K1280089023 UPDATE 12.01.2024 02:38:52: The customer analytics department contacted me and informed that they had deleted my account due to incomplete information.

They just don't care about customers. Period. I was looking for a dedicated server in a number of companies like OVH, Contabo and this joke of a company named Hetzner. So I found a nice server with a Ryzen 7900x cpu that caught my attention. Anyway I created my account to purchase(rent) this server, but noooo, there's a review process before you can do anything, so I waited for like 2-3 days for this review non-sense to finish, and during this time I emailed support asking them about a more powerful server with a 7950x cpu and I asked for a discounted price. They responded with a very vague and bad-taste response: ""I'm afraid both options are not offered or available."" Like did you get any training at all on how to speak to customers?! So I replied back telling him that the server is listed on the website so why are you saying it's not available? Of course he didn't reply. And remember the review process? I got an email telling me this: ""After reviewing your updated customer information, we have decided to deactivate your account because of some concerns we have regarding this information."" So they didn't like my personal information and decided to delete my account! Can't believe I wasted 3 days on this garbage. WHAT A JOKE COMPANY"

Hetzner even overtook OVH, which in 2013 was cooler, but in 10 years it never developed normally, and Hetzner constantly developed and made a cloud, made a convenient payment method, made an anti-dos, caught up and overtook OVH, which in 2023 even closed the loyalty program because of my greed, everything is so bad there now. In total, we now bring about 300-400 thousand euros to Hetzner from all hosting sites. but some fascist who hates Ukrainians blocks a Ukrainian account for no reason, where there are only 5 servers, where in general the servers were used for ordinary virtual machines for clients who don’t even have cool projects. in the end, this fascist only created problems and we now need to write to several dozen people so that they migrate to new orders. more details *hetzner-acc-blocked-why-support-hetzner-company.ru* - it’s just very disappointing when you brought several million euros of goods absolutely free, and you, like the scum of society, are blocked even without a clear reason.

Tim ViePrivé,PT,"Nov 14, 2023",1,Unacceptable Service and Unjustified Termination,"I am compelled to share my deeply disappointing experience with Hetzner. Initially, I chose their services with expectations of professionalism and reliability, but what followed was a series of regrettable incidents that have left me feeling exploited and disrespected. Firstly, the abrupt and unexplained termination of services was not just inconvenient, but also completely abusive in nature. As a customer, I was left in the dark with no prior warning or justification for this action. This arbitrary decision by Hetzner not only disrupted my plans but also showcased a complete disregard for customer engagement and transparency. I LOST MONEY! Additionally, the billing practices of Hetzner are nothing short of predatory. Despite canceling my services, I was charged for the full period, a clear indication of their indifference to fair business practices. This is not just about the financial loss, but also about the principle of fair and transparent transactions, which Hetzner has blatantly ignored. The quality of service, too, was consistently below par. Technical issues were a frequent occurrence, and the lack of effective solutions only added to the frustration. A service provider is expected to offer reliable and efficient solutions, but Hetzner failed miserably in this regard. To make matters worse, the attitude of the employees I interacted with was appalling. Far from being helpful and polite, they exhibited a level of impoliteness and unprofessionalism that has no place in any customer-oriented business. It's disheartening to encounter such behavior when you are seeking support and solutions. In conclusion, my experience with Hetzner has been nothing short of a nightmare. I strongly advise potential customers to reconsider their options before engaging with a company that has demonstrated such a profound lack of professionalism, customer care, and ethical business practices."

Invoicing: The invoicing system used is not clear and is complicated, this resulted in my service being stopped two times (18 days in total). 3.

Mick,AU,"Updated Nov 30, 2023",1,"39% (621 of 1,592) one-star customer reviews tells the real Hetzner story","39% one-star customer reviews – this tells you everything you need to know about Hetzner. The one-star reviews are worth a read if you are thinking about spending your money with Hetzner. My story... I am not a paying customer. I am a member of the public who raised a spam abuse complaint with Hetzner after a known serial spammer migrated to Hetzner's services and started spamming me using Hetzner's services. Hetzner are very aware that that this serial spammer, who is now also their paying customer, has no legitimate or legal authority to send me that spam. The kindest word I can use to describe Hetzner's responses - ""inadequate"". I am getting more and constant spam from the same spammer as a direct result of Hetzner's inadequate response. I can only imagine how much worse it must be for all those one-star review Hetzner customers who bothered to leave comments and feedback here. These people paid Hetzner money, and they received exactly the same shoddy, substandard, lousy service. On the upside – does mean Hetzner is consistent. On the downside – means Hetzner is consistent at delivering shoddy, substandard, lousy service. So the question you need to ask yourself - do you want to pay your hard-earned money to Hetzner just so that you can also experience their shoddy, substandard, lousy service? ***Updated 30-Nov-23 For transparency – Hetzner flagged this review with Truspilot on 9-Nov-23 because Hetzner did not think it was based on a genuine experience. I provided relevant evidence at the time to to support my review. That evidence included the ticket number in Hetzner's trouble ticketing system that Hetzner assigned to my complaint. It is now 21 days later and Hetzner are having another go at getting this review removed - again because they do not think that my report is based on a genuine experience. This latest attempt landed in my email in box a little after the response from Hetzner below. I just provided similar evidence again, this time to Trustpilot. I added copies of 3 of the 9 related emails I sent to Hetzner on this issue (each email had new spam evidence). The emails I provided tonight include Hetzner's own email sent by their trouble ticketing system when their staff created the ticket related to my complaint and copied and pasted some template response words to me. Hetzner will note that that ticket number is the same as I provided on 9-Nov-23 when I responded to their first takedown attempt. In my response to Trustpilot tonight, I also reiterated that: - I responded to Hetzner’s previous challenge on 9 November 2023. - I provided details of my communication with Hetzner in my original response. - When I raised my first spam abuse complaint with Hetzner, Hetzner notified the spammer of my details. Hetzner however never put my contact details on any suppression lists to prevent the spammer from emailing me while Hetzner was investigating. - After Hetzner notified the spammer of my complaint, the spammer started sending me spam more frequently from their Hetzner account. That continued until I received notification from Hetzner that they had locked the spammer’s account. - Notably, after Hetzner notified the spammer of my complaint, the spammer started spamming me using other services too, including a free email service. It is worth noting that when I raised spam abuse complaints with those other services, including the free email service, they appear to have immediately added my details to their respective suppression lists to prevent the spammer from emailing me. I rate those other services positively. But I see no reason to change my review about Hetzner."

Mohamed Bourbiza,IT,"Updated Nov 7, 2023",1,I am writing Disappointing Experience with Hetzner: A Word of Cautionthis review to share my…,"I am writing this review to share my disheartening experience with Hetzner, a company from which I had high expectations but that ultimately left me feeling disappointed and disrespected. My journey with Hetzner started off smoothly, but quickly took a turn for the worse, leading to a series of events that I believe potential customers should be aware of. Order and Initial Setup: My interaction with Hetzner began when I decided to order a server from them. The first day went well; I successfully installed everything I needed, including cPanel, CloudLinux LiteSpeed license, and other essential tools like JetBackup. I invested not only my time but also a significant amount of money into setting up the server to meet my requirements. Request for Personal Documents: The troubles started on the second day when I received an unexpected email from Hetzner asking me to send photocopies of my personal documents. Wanting to comply and assuming it was a standard security check, I promptly sent a photocopy of my identity card. However, this was just the beginning. Further Intrusive Requests: The following day, Hetzner sent me a link connected to an app, instructing me to take photos of my documents and my face. Despite my husband’s concerns about privacy and GDPR rules, I decided to comply with their request, trusting that it was a necessary step to verify my identity. Unjustified Suspension and Poor Customer Service: However, my compliance did not lead to a smoother experience. Two days later, Hetzner suspended my server while I was in the middle of important work for my news sites. Feeling anxious, I contacted Hetzner's customer service via email. It took them a staggering 8 hours to respond, only to send me another link connected to the same app, asking me once again to take photos of my documents and my face, this time with a threatening tone. I was appalled and replied that I had already submitted the required documents and photos twice, and it was unreasonable for them to ask me to do so repeatedly. I emphasized that we are not dealing with the CIA, and such intrusive requests were a violation of my privacy. Conclusion and Advice: Based on my experience, I would strongly advise against doing business with Hetzner. This ordeal was not only a waste of my time and resources but also a blatant disregard for customer privacy and satisfaction. My husband had a similar bad experience with them years ago, and I have come to learn that four of my journalist colleagues have also had negative encounters with this company. In conclusion, I implore potential customers to think twice before choosing Hetzner, as there are plenty of other companies out there that respect their customers and their privacy. UP 2: you are based in Europe, me too. There is a privacy law in Europe. but I sent my documents twice via your app. why did you suspend my server without notice and also deleted all my sites and I lost hours of work and spent more than 180 euros on the license that I bought? and even ask for documents and photos of my face the third time in a rude tone. someday it will end up in court and I'm sure it will."

It's not only misserable for such a large company to ignore my emails for support 10 days straight, then it's also funny how they threat customers. I really would love to use their service. But since UA passport doesn't fit them AT ALL, then it has no sense or whatever My colleagues tried making an account on Hetzner via UA passport and NEVER passed verification. Only the ones that had other passport from other countries passed with no problems. why the hell? PS: 02.11.23 As of now no response from support to ticket/mail/twitter, current reply of Hetzner here is nothing than just to improve situation. I contacted some of my relatives from RU/KZ regions and they were approved immediately with no issues. This happens only in UA region as I see from now"

The majority of 1-star reviews are from people who did not even use the service so they did not even have a contractual relationship, this is because they were rejected before starting to use the service. Understand guys that a company like Hetzner must be careful of its infrastructure, having systems and filters that help mitigate the possible bad intentions of some people. By doing this, Hetzner demonstrates good security practices and the seriousness they take in avoiding possible bad actors, therefore customers feel quite safe using the service. In my case with the Cloud service and Storage Share I am very pleased. I continue to wish the entire Hetzner organization much success."
Wine Country Flix,US,"Oct 17, 2023",5,"The best company I have found so far, so very sad :(","I have been with Hetzner off and on for about 5 years. Just signed up for an account a couple months ago for a dedicated server, I was very saddened when plex decided to ban my account simply because I'm with hetzner so I sadly have to move to another company. I signed up for this other provider the server delivery took 3 days then nothing works and I had to contact support and it takes them 24+ hours to respond and they are very vague not really answering any questions. Hetzners server are delivered in maybe 2 hours at most their response time is never longer than about 6 hours and they are always willing to help. Makes me very sad to leave. My favorite company and I hope they can overcome this Plex BS and I will be back in a second."
Graham Hill,ZA,"Updated Oct 17, 2023",1,Worth Knowing you are a criminal if you don't live in Europe,"Honestly, can't recommend them. Created an account and they wanted either a copy of my ID or a 20 euro payment since where I live I'm considered high risk. I will not use the services of a company that treat me as a criminal and I would recommend all others steer clear. Adding onto this since Hetzner flags accounts claiming they are high risk, refusing to allow service operation until either ID or 20 euro is paid to ""authenticate."" I will leave it at this, as I have used other services situated across Europe and none of them have requested me to upload documents to confirm ""I am not high risk."""
Mees,NL,"Oct 11, 2023",4,Great hosting provider with lots of potential,"It has been a year since my last review on Hetzner and in the meantime a lot changed. Where I first only used their cloud services, I currently have used almost every product their offer. I feel like it's fair to reconsider my last review based on my experiences with Hetzner's other products. First of all, my opinion on Hetzner's cloud services remain the same. I still think they're absolutely amazing. For an amazing price you get a Cloud experience that no other provider in this market has been able to offer me. In addition to Hetzner cloud, I have used both their storage boxes and shares. Two fantastic products for a great price. With the storage boxes, my largest issue has been the security. It's only possible to get a randomly generated, (in my opinion) fairly simple, password. Setting your own password isn't an option. It's also not possible to configure any IP whitelists for connections to the storage box. This theoretically makes your storage box vulnerable for brute-force attacks and any unauthorized connections. The folks at Hetzner told me that these two features are things they fortunately are working on improving, which is good to know. For now, I'd recommend encrypting the files you store on your storage box, for example via EncFS. Storage shares do not have the problem as described above, but don't really work great in combination with servers as your only option is to use WebDAV mounts. On the other hand, I would totally recommend storage shares for people who are less tech savvy and are looking for affordable cloud storage. A product of Hetzner that I started using recently is their web hosting services. I must say that I do not recommend these services (for now), since it feels highly outdated. KonsoleH feels old fasioned and is slow (especially when loading backups) and difficult to use. The webmail interface also isn't any better. I currently still use their web hosting services, but solely for the email. Last product that I have (and currently still do) used is Hetzner's dedicated servers. To be honest, my first experience in January this year with this product hasn't been any good. Especially my experience with Hetzner's sales department was a horrible one that completely changed how I felt about Hetzner. First of all, the live support chat was anything but live. Replies between messages took around 15 minutes. The replies that I got primarily were snippets copy-pasted straight from their documentation website (which I have also read myself and asked further questions about in this live chat), causing my questions to be left unanswered. Last, the sales agent felt rude and disinterested in the products where I was looking for more information about. Even though this bad pre-sales experience I decided to order the dedicated server. The support I got from the data center technicians unfortunately wasn't much better. For example, my request for a KVM console with bootable USB stick got rejected because my desired ISO should also be available in their installimage tool. While this tool indeed works, it also destroys the pureness of the operating system as this tool pre-installs tools and pre-configures settings. This experience is also something I have read more complaints about on Hetzner's community on Reddit. Hetzner's data center technicians shouldn't be taking a judging approach in the customers' requests (as long as these comply with the terms of serivce of course), and thus should attach the KVM console and bootable USB stick regardless. Around 9 months later I decided to give Hetzner another chance and ordered a dedicated server again. This time I didn't ask my questions to their sales department but instead directly to the product team. This team has taken the time to answer my questions and did a much better job than the sales department did back in January. Thus, I decided to place the order for my dedicated server. This time, my KVM console with bootable USB stick got accepted straight away and the console got attached within around 20 minutes after my initial request, which is amazing and much better than what happened in my previous time of having a dedicated server at Hetzner. Now that I have my dedicated server for around 1 month, I can safely say this experience has been great so far. Both my experiences with their email and phone support have been good, and response times are always low, even during the weekends and nights. I don't have that much characters left, but last I want to say is that Hetzner has a lot of potential and after all still is a great provider for the price you pay. What I do think is that Hetzner should work on improving their support. For example by offering their employees better training and extending their support hours; after all, the internet never sleeps."
Taylor,US,"Oct 11, 2023",5,"Exceptional Service from Robin at Hetzner: Prompt Email Responses, Detailed Guidance, and Top-Quality Server Performance Surpassing All Expectations","I recently had the privilege of working with Robin from Sales and Product Advice at Hetzner.

Having read about their custom solutions, I reached out and was paired with Robin. He clearly outlined what was required, explained the special ordering process in detail (required for my customizations), and provided exact pricing. The email support was so prompt, it felt like live chat; Robin responded within 5 minutes every time. As for the quality of the servers, they get an A+.

While I understand the frustrations, I applaud Hetzner for doing their job correctly by maintaining their high professional ethics and service. In my time as a devoted client the support has been fantastic. Responses to support tickets often within the hour, a few hours at worst. The quality vs. price is the icing on the cake. I cant remember the last time any of my client sites had an interruption in service or downtime. So yes, if you looking for instant gratification and getting a site online in minutes, be prepared to be frustrated.

Chris Stauffer,IE,"Updated Aug 11, 2023",5,"Less than optimal sign up process, great product","(I originally reviewed with 1 star due to the signup process: Hetzner has a signup process that makes you verify your account (fair enough). In the case of a company this is done by uploading e.g. a certificate of incorporation. I got rejected a short while after that. All they knew about me at that stage was that I'm an Irish company, registered a couple years ago, as well as my credit card info (3d secured card). If that's enough reason to reject me as a customer, I'd have appreciated it if they had done that straight away and not after I uploaded my companies certificate. After my 1 star review here, Hetzner re-evaluated my case and activated my account the next day. I understand why Hetzner has to protect themselves against certain risk, but if the verification process is so prone to keep out legitimate customers, there really should be a better appeals process than being a ""Karen"" and going to TrustPilot.) Having said all that, once you're verified, the ordering process is straight forward. I'm now using a StorageBox (smallest one for testing purposes) and the setup process both for access via SMB and FTP is straight forward, well documented and works perfectly fine.

I have been with them for a little over 3 years now and I have had no issues, sometimes support can take a little while to respond but otherwise it's 10/10. The DDos protection while not perfect is nowhere near as bad as people say as its saved us a few times from bad actors. Their price is great too so if you can use them i'd highly recommend getting your servers from them. I do wish though if it's possible to get some lower end and slightly cheaper dedicated servers such as when I first started they had server auction machines for 25 euro I also would like upgrades to the lower end like the ax41 still being stuck on 3rd gen Ryzen (Ryzen 5 3600)"
Panda Palle,DK,"Jul 23, 2023",1,9 months to solve a case,"All in all, I've actually been quite satisfied with Hetzner. The incident that changed it for me was a simple customer case regarding their email filtering option that took them 9 months to give me clear answer to. Several times they promised to reach out for further information and get back to me, but they never did so I repeatedly had to bump the case. The case was initially created in November 2022. The final response from Hetzner arrived a few days ago here in July 2023, after I had to bump the case again after waiting 3 months since our last conversation regarding the case. That's a total of 9 months treatment time for a simple question. This is totally unacceptable and after I told them this, no response at all. We have now taken the appropriate steps and decided to move all our domains and VPS instances to a new provider. Customer satisfaction and trust is so important and unfortunately Hetzner failed to deliver. Despite their cheap prices, the customer care needs serious attention. You can't expect customers to wait for months for an answer and if you promise the customer that you will get back with further information when available and you decide to commit to this, then either live up to it or don't promise anything at all. Thanks for now and good luck to Hetzner in the future."

According our tecnical staff there was not any spamming issue at all, this was only Hetzner staff story. => We wanted to close this server and move it to other company. Hetzner also closed the Cpanel and internet connection, and did not let move anything out. They just sent invoice every month and nothing was done. They are completely criminals. I noticed that other customer has similar problems with Hetzner. 3) - We also had cloud from this company. They told that someone had hacked this cloud server/service and sent almost 900 euro monthly invoice. Actually all login details showed thay that only Hetzner staff could do this themselves, because no order confirmation from new services never came. Never buy anything from this company."

Ahmed,EG,"Jun 3, 2023",3,Hetzner provides a good services but…,"Hetzner provides a good services but didn’t suit me. When it comes to support it’s certainly good. Very fast response in business hours and better than competitors such as OVH. In terms of performance they are also competitive and provide good performance. In terms of the prices. Good but the ipv4 prices is super expensive. It led me to cancel 2 servers there with alot of IPs each. And their setup fees for the IPs is super expensive The thing that didn’t work for me was the DDoS protection. It’s good and they have tweaked it recently and it blocks the attacks with no significant downtime but there are few drawbacks to consider: 1-Slow activation time. It takes about 5 minutes to identify the attack and to route the traffic to their protection tunnels. That wasn’t the biggest issue for me but it was something to consider. 2-Interrupts the first connection TCP handshake which makes the websites that are using Cloudflare or any CDN, Reverse proxy goes down when there is an attack. (Biggest drawback to me) 3-Sometimes the attack doesn’t reach their threshold to activate the protection. Which makes the server goes down and the protection is never triggered. 4-No option to enable permanent mitigation. After contacting their support their wouldn’t be a possibility to do much customization here. Which led me to stop using their services after 3 years of use. However it’s recommended for people who aren’t getting frequent DDoS which wasn’t my case."

Ricardo Molendijk,NL,"May 25, 2023",1,Extremely Disappointed with Hetzner: Unfair Disabling of Service and Unresponsive Support,"I am writing this review to express my extreme dissatisfaction with Hetzner, based on the harrowing experience I had with their services. My frustration began when Hetzner falsely disabled my service without any valid reason, citing a baseless abuse notice claiming that we had changed the MAC address. However, in reality, all we had done was install an operating system called Harvester, which apparently triggered their misguided response. To resolve this issue, I initiated multiple contact emails with their support team, hoping for a fair and reasonable resolution. Unfortunately, Hetzner's support staff showed a complete disregard for our legitimate claims and stubbornly refused to acknowledge their mistake. Despite providing ample evidence that the alleged MAC address change was false and explaining the harmless nature of our actions, they turned a blind eye and seemed uninterested in understanding our side of the story. What is more disheartening is that instead of addressing our concerns seriously, Hetzner has taken the outrageous step of involving debt collectors in an attempt to coerce payment from our company. This heavy-handed approach is both unprofessional and alarming, considering the lack of evidence or proper investigation on their part. It feels like they are more interested in extracting money from their customers rather than resolving disputes fairly. Throughout our correspondence with Hetzner's support team, their responses were frustratingly unhelpful and disheartening. Instead of providing any meaningful assistance or addressing our specific concerns, they resorted to sending back generic and dismissive comments. Their lack of empathy and unwillingness to engage in a genuine dialogue is indicative of a company that has lost sight of the importance of customer service. As a customer, I made great efforts to communicate and work towards a resolution, expecting a fair and professional response from Hetzner. However, their actions have not only tarnished our experience but have also raised serious doubts about their integrity and commitment to customer satisfaction. I strongly advise potential customers to think twice before considering Hetzner as their service provider. Their unjustified disabling of services, refusal to accept responsibility, and involvement of debt collectors demonstrate a blatant disregard for their customers' rights and well-being. It is clear that Hetzner lacks the necessary customer-centric approach and fails to provide the level of service and support one would expect from a reputable company in the industry."

John F.,CN,"May 20, 2023",1,Frustrating account verification,"I attempted to register for a Hetzner account with my real identity twice, only to have my account closed both times. Hetzner seems to believe they have sufficient justification for their actions. However, they fail to acknowledge any shortcomings in their verification process, most notably the complete lack of communication with their users. As a result, customers are forced to bear the costs of potential false account attacks that should be Hetzner's responsibility. What's even more absurd is that, despite my inability to register my account with my real identity, I can still easily purchase someone else's registered Hetzner account for as little as 10 USD (although I have not done so). If I had any intent on engaging in ""suspicious activities"", wouldn't purchasing an account be a more convenient option? Perhaps Hetzner's technical support is top-notch, justifying their title as a ""Platinum Service Provider"". But all of these benefits hinge on you being lucky enough to pass their verification system. A quick glance at other reviews shows that the number of dissatisfied users due to account verification issues is quickly approaching the number of satisfied users. In my opinion, Hetzner's account verification team is protecting their service's reliability in a self-destructive manner, killing a thousand enemies at the expense of losing their own 800."
Mark Genney,CO,"Updated May 30, 2023",1,Easily the worst domain provider.,"Our company buys domains from 5 different providers, so hopefully we have a broad enough experience of different companies and I am certain that that Hetzner is the worst one. I realised this week that the one .de domain we have with Hetzner is not working so I went to log into the console to find I don't have an account. After confirming client details with support. Hetzner confirmed the domain had not been paid and the account was deleted. So for a start. I don't know why they would delete a client account for this reason. They act like that is a normal thing to do. I am certain that were I to cancel all our domains with GoDaddy for example they would not delete my existence because I might want to purchase another domain. Hetzner has told me that I can reactivate the account by wire payment. That is workable. However they are apparently unable to send me the invoice. They simply keep repeating that they have send it to the email address I have on file. I have never received any emails whatsoever from Hetzner apart from replies to support enquiries. I have been charged annually to the company debit card. I have never received a notification that payment will be taken, an invoice, or confirmation that services have been renewed. Given the lack of comms, I was not aware the payment had failed, nor that I was due a payment, nor that the service had been suspended. I don't even know why the payment would have failed, our account has plenty of funds. Perhaps their payment gateway also does not work. Given the lack of invoice received when they insist they keep sending it, and the lack of communication of any kind over the previous 4 years. I have come to suspect that Hetzner does not even have the correct email for me on file. I did update it in 2017 in the console and I think that might have not updated their actual comms. Support is completely useless. They are now telling me ""if you do not receive it you have to check your settings we can't do anything at this point."" This has nothing to do with email settings. The email address works. I think the problem is that they are not sending the invoice or they have the wrong email address. I have asked them to simply attach the invoice to the email conversation. Apparently they are incapable of doing that. So Hetzner does not have access to its own invoices? This is definitely a waste of time and I am getting nowhere with them. Should you be in the market for a new domain name, do yourself a favour and use a provider that is less incompetent. UPDATE: 30 May 2023: Read the response from Hetzner. My review was about finding myself without an account and my domain name unpaid because I did not get any comms from them. They say they have sent the invoice, they say they have sent it again. Obviously I have not received anything because that is what the problem is. They have not offered to send the invoice as an attachment to the support conversation. They have not explained why they have deleted my entire client account. I am sure I would be able to see invoices there had they not done that. Thankfully just after my review the domain was released and I just bought it again via another provider. Happy to not have to deal with Hetzner ever again."

The mails were not sent through our server, this is proven by the log attached by Hetzner. Now hetzner is threatening to ban us from the IP address of the server we rented if we don't declare the mailing. I have sent several times a statement that we do not acknowledge the problem as it is not our leased server that is sending the spam. The customer concerned has already resolved the problem to my knowledge. For over a week they have been messaging me and threatening me to admit to an incident that I had nothing to do with.

FFO,GB,"Updated May 16, 2023",1,I am very concerned!!,"I am very concerned!! Last week I spent close to one hour with a very polite Hetzner representative, discussiong the possibilities of me trying out its hosting services. He was great at describing some the benefits that I could expect and what I liked was his candidness about what was on offer and what was not. I proceeded to create an account the day before yesterday and was requested to provide ID for verification purposes. In spite of not liking to send my ID details across the internet, as a lawyer, I am aware of the KYC challenges that companies have with dealing with faceless customers, so I duly sent across my passport copy. I then received the following email: ""After reviewing your updated customer information, we have decided to deactivate your account because of some concerns we have regarding this information. Therefore, we have cancelled all your existing products and orders with us. Best regards Your Hetzner Online Team"" I was aghast, thinking could this have been because I sent my passport details, which reveals a person of African origins. Surely not? But there was no other plausible explanation to draw from. They have enough info on me to do a simple search if that is in fact necessary. I note from the complaints that this is a common issue with Hetzner, if they are using some form of AI to filter their customer base, I request that they need to look at the algorithm, because it clearly has some in built bias that is harming their reputation. I have requested an explanation by phone and by email and have not received anything yet. I am forced to take this a little more public in the hope of receiving an explanation and a reversal of this absurd decision. I sincerely hope that this was merely a blip in your system - the account number in question is as follows: K0557498923 I await Hetzner’s response. I have just received a request from Hetzner requesting that I provide more details about this case for verification of who I am. This reference number - K0557498923 will provide you will all the details that you need. Afterall, your system was very able to take my debit card details and a copy of my passport. and you have my initials - I do not think it is wise for Hetzner to suggest that i am some kind of phantom complainant. Please get in touch by email as I have requested you to do. My reply to Hetzner's response. Again I am aghast at Hetzner's approach here. So I provide a non European name, together with my passport, which identifies the same said name that I used in opening the account and you dare to go public to say this is a fake name. This is a disgrace and I have no doubt that in good conscience you realise that too. I not only sent you my payment details (also highlighting my name, a copy of my passport, I then provided you with details of my public profile, which is significant as it shows me in the same light, same name, same business that I would have been using your services for and more over, it is an extremely well known entity; but of course your powerful computers and the algorithm it uses trumps all of this very weighty evidence, that in legal terms we would describe as incontrovertible evidence. If you think I would go to all this trouble to highlight this kind of treatment, you are wrong. But it is very clear that your reliance on tech without plain common sense is really beyond belief, and has the potential to wreck your reputation and business. Given your GDPR obligations I want an official email making it very clear that all the personal details that you have taken from me will be deleted and permanently destroyed - and I go on public by saying that if this is not done by the close of business today I will be taking this further. Many thanks, FFO"

Michel,NL,"May 9, 2023",5,"Two years, no problems","I have been with Hetzner for a little over two years now. Never really had any issues. I am renting both dedicated and virtual servers. The panel(s) are very easy to use and navigation through the control panel is easy. Fair prices for good quality. I like the storage box option. What I really love about Hetzner is the invoice reminders, and overview. They are transparent with what and when you need to pay and they will send you plenty of emails before the expiration date. Would love to see an integration with iDEAL so I don't have to use PayPal all the time. As with any hosting provider you need to understand what you're doing, hence why some of the reviews here are bad."

Fredrick,US,"May 5, 2023",5,"Great Service, Great Products","Reading through the reviews motivated me to leave a product review. I recently became a customer because of frustration with business practices of USA based tech companies surrounding clean energy, data protection, etc... as well as all the ancillary costs incurred by setting up infrastructure on the big three cloud platforms (AWS, Google, Azure) . After some research I settled on Hetzner and have been super happy with them so far. Their CAX VPS instances (of which I already have many) are an amazing value for performance and have also picked up a server from the server auction for less than €60/mo that would cost me at least $300/mo elsewhere. Additionally, their support has been very responsive the few times I've contacted them. The community support for tools like terraform to manage infrastructure, dns entries, etc. was also great to see and a huge deciding factor when making my choice. Overall, I have been very happy with my decision to build our new product on Hetzner and will recommend them to others every chance I get."

Basing this on nextcloud is a very smart move as it works well and is constantly updated. Then when i had an issue, the support fixed it in one day moving around my 3Tb of data to a better server. So i'm really glad i found that company! I can safely sync all my important data and share it between 3 computers without worrying."

I realized that i just from 3rd country that maybe many of other people on my country use this service to do some illegal thing maybe so they just reject me again and again. Also, they say can accept paypal, but when I register i must use CC to finish the registration. even after i login (before sent document ID) there is only CC on the payment method. I dont know is my document ID will be delete or will always save by them, i regret to give them my data for nothing.

I have been seriously mistaken when I trusted them to leave my website without a backup copy and currently I do not have a copy and try to communicate with them, but there is no point where there is no one who holds them accountable for this. They did not allow me to make a backup copy of my site despite that, that is, a stupid policy, that they are wrong with what they do with their judgment on us. The Customer Data Analytics section is very stupid with their ruling on us, it is really a great loss to the company. The company must reconsider this stupid section as soon as possible. I will write about them in all review sites to show their reality, that I really are very annoyed with the loss of my data because of this stupid section and their stupid ruling.

Now they are just expensive, if you ask them for a small intervention, it can take days for them even to reply. Let alone actually do the intervention.

They talk over you and then hang up when trying to talk to them and fyi, this is their business model. THREE (3) different people hung up on me and mind you, we are on speaker phone. There was never any profanity used. There was a day due to being in different countries. They did not like hearing a so called loud voice and the answer was to hang up three different times. They are not good people. They hate this work. Thats for sure. And, this is not even going into how the server goes down every 8 days. Thats the issue. Yet trying to get any help is pathetic. Its so bad. I would never call them again or deal with this company. I am ftp'ing out right now. This was a nightmare and all I did was go to sleep and wake up to a server not working and then I was hung up on three time because their little feelings got hurt. Meanwhile, my server is down and my account is locked because we could not get in to reset it but their feelings were so hurt because of a loud vocal that they hung up THREE TIMES rather than help. They actually talked about wanting to help. I kept saying instead of talking about wanting to help that they should just help but thats not a thing at hetzner. They would rather use part of their odd fifteen minutes of fame to use its power because they have control of your server. Its the exact thing to never do when being a host company. They are evil people. I am serious. They are downright evil to do this to people. You feel helpless and they know it. They take advantage of it. They use it.

Houman,GB,"Nov 28, 2022",4,I'm really surprised about the bad…,"I'm really surprised about the bad reviews here. I have been a customer of Hetzner for five years. Throughout this period, I had various dedicated and cloud servers with them. Our business would be difficult to run without Hetzner. Their servers are very fast and very well configured. You get a whole IPv6 64 subnet, which is also routed to the VM. Surprisingly, only a handful of providers can achieve such great server configurations. Hetzner handles abuse claims well and has overall an efficient customer service. The prices are good and you get pretty much unlimited traffic. There are only two drawbacks: 1) As you would probably expect from a German company, the customer service etiquette and friendliness are not their strongest suit. Instead of a robotic ""Dear client"", how about using the customer's name? 2) Hetzner is the only server provider that I have seen over the years with an anti-port scanning mechanism. This creates a lot of false-positives and a lot of headaches for the customer, especially if you run a VPN on the server. Sometimes genuine music apps scans ports, but that doesn't mean that this is a malicious act. Hetzner needs to rethink that. Overall highly recommended."

Jorge,FR,"Updated Dec 8, 2022",2,Something really strange happened in a Cloud server from Hetzner,"Something really strange happened. One day, my cloud server was unresponsive for no reason via ssh. I was able to connect via the console from the Hetzner website but I could not connect via ssh. I thought my server was hacked. i have been able to check user logs in using the console. I didn't find anything. Strangely, i could not ping from the server to the outside world. I tried to reset my server but there was no improvement. I only saw that there was many DHCP requests in the system log file from my server to the host system of Hetzner. So, to me it looked like the router of Hetzner was dead because these DHCP requests weren't answered by the router. At some point, I received a message from Hetzner that was displayed on my private dashboard, saying something like, your server is locked, some maintenance should be done on the host system. meanwhile, I restored the last backup. And then, everything came back to normal. My server was down for 10h00 and it started just after 00:00 I received no email from Hetzner but I am sure the problem came from Hetzner. Also, I checked the maintenance history of hetzner and nothing was mentioned. So, I think that Hetzner hides their malfunctions.

They refused to help us, raising 'abuse reports' instead ...customer service? ...WHAT customer service! So we had to guess the network configuration that works with additional subnets. This took time - a lot of time - and their systems could not even filter out harmless ARP broadcasts. We have since implemented ARP firewalls to further block virtual MACs but on the very day they emailed to say that the 'abuse' problem had been resolved, they 'locked' the IP address which immediately caused our clients' most critical business apps, email and website services to go dark. This has caused us untold reputational harm and I am gobsmacked that any modern business could deem it acceptable to do such a thing. I am livid and right now, cannot possibly recommend the services of Hetzner to anyone."

Andrea Vörös,GB,"Oct 7, 2022",1,Wiped all company data. 3 years of work is lost,"Have been a customer for over 3 years. Our credit card expired on the account over the last two weeks of holiday period in UK in August, we received payment reminders for 2 weeks and our account and entire data got wiped for failing to pay within one month of invoice date in total. 2 weeks of payment notification only! One could be in hospital or not have access to emails for that period of time, anything can happen! Whereas we understand we failed to make payment on time, to wipe all of our data is just not acceptable. Be careful when you sign with Hetzner and I hope you never do! Their terms and conditions are vague, they pretty much say they can cancel your account any time on non-payment without advising you a timeline ahead when you sign a contract with them. 3 years of data has been lost. Terms and conditions of course do not discuss ‘wiping data’ just cancellation of contract. You would understand if you do not have access to the account after a month of non-payment but to entirely wipe everything? Have you heard anything like that before? We did not have a back up! I have to also write about the customer experience. I have been treated with such disrespect, superiority, and arrogance in conversations. The experience was simply awful and inhumane. When I described the customer experience to the team leader I was told ‘I do not believe you. I hear every single conversation the team has’. (Bear in mind it is impossible to listen to every conversation simply when you have 2 or more team members even!!!) Perhaps he does not even realise himself what customer service means. Anybody with Hetzner, do look for an alternative hosting company with common sense. Lastly, no compensation was offered, not even one month of free hosting. All costs involved we must suffer as a company. How is this treatment possible in Germany???"

My customers have just been delighted with the service I'm able to provide thanks to Hetzner.

Instead of engaging with their customer, they only try to save their own ass and send this stupid emails saying ""sorry we cannot give you any specific reason, but we are happy to immediately block your account. thank you for wasting your time and money here. come back if you are stupid or desperate enough"". Absolutely no alert. Absolutely no engagement. Absolutely no transparency. We launched Zimbra email service on one of the servers. if was compromised and was sending spams. Hetzner immediately blocked the IP before informing us (they informed us using the email that they blocked and we could not access). and also locked the account for 1 month. we shut down the email server and moved to Zoho. but still no luck. they are happy to keep the account locked for 1 month. then they consider our request if they are in a good mood (literally).

Probably, some new management by a moody teenager. They don't even try to pretend they care. I have been customer for 7+ years. They sell servers with unlimited traffic. So we advertised our services on their servers with unlimited traffic. It happened that one of our services was using ""a lot"" of traffic, they sent a threat that we are abusing traffic and violating ToS and we might get banned if we don't reduce our usage. Please not it was only 1 server out of all my servers, in 7 years, that had a high traffic usage. Despite the lie of unlimited traffic, I clearly stated that a friendly notice would be enough and I am willing to reduce traffic usage. I started to reduce traffic usage after the message by 40% by adding a speed limit on my servers. Also, I was never asked to reduce traffic and refused it. When I asked, what solution they want me to do, they advised me to split services on more servers to balance things. So, I did, I ordered a new server to split things, but to my surprise my new order was not delivered for weeks and when I asked, I was told I am blacklisted from ordering. I explained the situation, but they choose to ignore further communication with me despite being willing to work things out with them in a friendly way. It is a bit painful after so many years for them to show 0 signs of caring about loyal customers. I feel bad and deceived for having recommended their services a lot in the last few years. Edit: unfortunately after the reply from Hetzner below, it seems Katie from Hetzner was curious about the issue as posted below and reached out to ask for my email. While I appreciate the attempt. but you say you don't want to talk it about it publicly ""for privacy reasons"", that's ok, but and when I contact your support privately they don't reply neither, you have been ignoring my emails for a while now. @hetzner/katie, you already have my email as provided few days ago, if you would like to help you can contact me it will be appreciated.

As most startups, mine failed as well and I wanted to close my account at Hetzner. I made a mistake of closing the email address first which we used to sign up for Hetzner so I needed to request a new login from them. Hetzner didn't accept my details via email due to security reasons, so instead I had to print out, fill in by hand, scan and send back the same details in a random pdf document via email. Hetzner then managed to send the login details via snailmail to an incomplete address (so much for security). I had to reach out to them to mail it to the correct address. Once I could login again, I tried deleting the account but I was unable to as it said I still have active services running. I'm a non-technical person and the developer who worked with me is long gone so I had to reach out to Hetzner customer service again to ask where and what do I have to cancel. I followed the link they provided and closed whatever I found to be still active. I reached out to them for confirmation that everything's closed and whether I can delete my account now. They confirmed that there are no services running and I should receive one final invoice on 1 August 2022, then I should be able to delete the account. I received the invoice on 1 August, they charged my card on 2 August. On 9 August I went to their site to delete the account and guess what? I cannot because apparently I still have some active services running. So now I wonder if despite all my efforts to get rid of this scammy company will my card be charged again, for services I don't use and begging them to close for over a month. AVOID.

About 10 months later I cancelled the services. I then received notice saying that I hadn't transferred the domain out. I immediately contacted them and advised that I did not want it and they advised to log in and cancel the domain on their platform. I did this immediately. Today I receive notification of a bill for a renewed year despite the cancellation. There was not advance warning that the domain was about to be renewed - no contact from the company whatsoever. They did manage to send a notice when they have taken payment however. This is underhand. Having contacted their support, they provide no explanation for the lack of advance warning and just revert to their terms and conditions and state it is open-ended. Their business practices are deceitful at best and only notify the customer when it is to the benefit of the company itself. Best avoided. There are plenty of better services out there that are much more honourable. UPDATE: Having lodged a claim with my bank, I reviewed the dates of the service and the domain I have been charged for in July does not expire until November. Anyone with a domain with this company, please check your renewal dates urgently."

umbrellawaves,IL,"Jul 19, 2022",4,Great prices on cloud VPS. You get what you pay for.,"Very cheap hosting on their cloud platform. Customer service is terrible and rented, dedicated servers have uptime issues, but the cloud VPS is a very stable product. Payments protip: Load several months/years of credit onto your account by overpaying an invoice via SEPA transfer to their IBAN account (list your account number, ask their customer support for more info). This will prevent you from running into payment issues if you have issues with your card payment as they'll just take money out of your ""balance""."

I have spent almost 2k EUR for server rent, and I wasn't very satisfy with it's performance, so I decided to cancel servers during first 14 days. That means they must refund my money back, no questions asked. But in reality they refusing to refund me back. They replied in my email that I need to open chargeback with my bank. Is this joke? Because my bank manager told me that in that case there will be 45 EUR dispute investigation fee and that it may take up to 10 business days to process my request. Basically, I feel that something really wrong is going on here. I am ready to start legal action, because I am absolutely sure that I don't need to waste my money to receive refund.

Joe Richards,AU,"Jun 18, 2022",1,Could kill everything you build at Hetzner at any time,"Rejected account without reason. All details provided including mobile number, address, card which matched details. Got the classic: ""After reviewing your updated customer information, we have decided to deactivate your account because of some concerns we have regarding this information. Therefore, we have cancelled all your existing products and orders with us."" Imagine if you had a whole cluster of essential services running at Hetzner and they just KILLED them all at once like that. Forget load balancers, forget backup servers, forget HA replication or virtualisation. You can't get away from the real danger: HETZNER ONLINE seem to be the single point of failure. I would avoid them like the plague and feel lucky to know straight off at the start about the danger our company could have faced being cancelled without any process, transparency or accountability. If you're actually planning to run business-critical services on these servers you'd be better off with a reliable company like Amazon Web Services, Azure, OVH, Vultr, DigitalOcean or Linode. Sure their servers seem cheap but can you afford to be cancelled with no notice or reason on same vague suspicion they have or might form at some stage? Wording on your website, an IP address you log in from, somebody looked funny at the person working in their ""customer service"" centre that morning and they decided to take it out on you?"
William Nelson,US,"Jun 17, 2022",4,"Decent, could be better with abuse","Decent. I believe the VPS hosting has a lot of issues with bandwidth. It would randomly be super high CPU some days when my website wasn't getting any more requests than normal, leading me to believe they're not really monitoring what other people are doing causing bandwidth shortages. This makes sense, given I've heard a lot of stories about abuse by hetzner customers, and not much action being taken. I've personally reported several IPs for DDoSing my websites and get no response from their support. Other services provide more reliable VPS hosting, though hetzner is still decent."

I myself am from Russia and after the war started it was impossible to pay via PayPal, cards and other payment methods, so the server was transferred to a large reseller, where it was safely kept for two months. But because the prices there are unadequate (twice as high as the real ones) I asked a colleague from Ukraine to make an account and pay for the server, and I will transfer money to the crypto exchange for him. My colleague successfully registered, passed verification (there was no verification when I registered earlier), attached his bank card. I got an e-mail saying that my account was verified and everything was ok. I wrote to the reseller that I needed to transfer the server, he gave me the Robot key, I initiated the transfer and he confirmed it. At that point the server was up and running, was paid for 20 days in advance and nothing seemed to be going wrong. In the morning I couldn't connect to the server and I texted my colleague, to which he replied that he couldn't log in either. After contacting tech support it turned out that they deleted his account without explanation, and along with it the server. Called and the hotline, there is absolutely horrible tech support, who said to their faces that we do not care about your data, you violated the rules, but what we can not say, and we also deleted the server. In short, lost tens of thousands of dollars in information and code on this server, I recommend to bypass this office.

Instead of performing the cancellation request I have sent them they stated ""helping"" me with the secondary issue. I had made my request prior to any invoice being generated for the next cycle and at the end of that billing cycle, therefore by delaying the answer to my request their system invoiced me the next day. Although I have informed them of that, they declined to perform the cancellation of my service, and forced me to pay for that invoice so I can do the cancellation from their client area. I made sure I had remove any funds from that credit card, as I was sure they will try to withdraw that wrongfully payment, and I was right to do so as the next day I had received an message from them and from my bank that an withdrawal attempt has been made. Fortunate, we, me and Hetzner, are both located in Europe, and I will inform the authorities of this illegally procedure they are running. As in Europe all customers are protected by law for any online purchase for a longer period of time. If you intend to buy services from this company I would advise that you use an virtual credit card so that you can dispose of it in case you stumble upon this type of fraud. Also, If you are or had been in my situation I also advise you to alert the German authorities of consumer protection."

More information about Hetzner's unwarranted and unexplained attack on important Ukrainian infrastructure has been provided by the Ukrainian Government. As links are not allowed on this platform, please search for ""german-hosting-provider-hetzner-online-gmbh-blocks-access-ukraines-key-online-platform-which-provides-information-international-community-about-russias-invasion-ukraine"" to read a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Had Hetzner not given the impression it sides with Russia through its actions, I would have left a 3* review. - Sudden price increases with little notice, claiming it's due to increased energy costs (which I understand and the increases aren't terrible), but then simultaneously running very expensive new advertising campaigns on multiple YouTube channels and with large 'creators' (10m+ subs). That sends entirely the wrong message. - OVH - a much larger company with sub-brands - is now more competitive than Heztner. - Some of those who have complained to Hetzner have reported (with verification/proof) horror stories of their experience, including Hetzner wiping their servers without notice. This is not an acceptable way to run a datacentre/company."

Support is phenomenal and their services are top tier for any business or a private person. ** THIS WAS A 5 STAR REVIEW ** After some time my server started to get DDOS-ed, I ask their network team to block access to the IPs (I sent them a list of 1.5k+ IPs and WireShark logs) to which they responded ""it's impossible to block that many IPs"". They also responded in their email to me that ""we don't offer a permanent ddos mitigation to our customer. We only offer a ddos protection when a big attack is going on your server."" which was infuriating, they don't mention this on their website. What this means pretty much is that if someone was to DDOS you, they need to send a huge number of smaller packets to kill the connection to your server - Hetzner ""anti DDOS"" will NOT pick that up and you are left to deal with this yourself (their network team told me to install a 3rd party solution on a Windows server to mitigate this), their ""anti-DDOS"" is very trivial and will only pick up ""big attacks"". I can recommend Hetzner ONLY IF: - You are hosting websites behind CloudFlare and your IP NEVER EVER gets leaked to public - Small personal projects - If you have money to set up a Linux box as a load balancer with NGINX and make your other servers work through that load balancer (if you are worried about DDOS) I do NOT RECOMMEND them for game server hosting if your only option is one server with them and you can't set up load balancing / iptables."

SecurityJunky,DE,"Updated Feb 20, 2022",5,Hetzner Storage Box,"Hello, I first got myself a 5TB storage box. (In the end, it will probably amount to 10TB). Actually incredible how cheap this is offered. I use it as a pure backup of my NAS. Especially the different protocols have convinced me. I also just wanted the storage. No front-end, no sharing, no nothing. Perfect. The only thing that almost made me cancel the box and order a new one is the fact that ""rm -rf folderName"" is not allowed. In the end, I was able to use FileZilla to delete the test data in just about acceptable time. My solution now is to take a snapshot at the very beginning. Should I want to start from scratch again, I can quickly ""reset"" the box. Recursive deletion would still be another plus (or did I miss something there?). I can blindly recommend the box to anyone who needs a pure backup or storage expansion of a server. I use it on a Synology NAS with Syncovery, Hyper Backup (both encrypted or not depending on the data), MacBook Air 2020 as a pure additional drive and small backup of important data using Syncovery (encrypted), as on the iPhone in Files (with FE File Explorer) and Koder. For me the perfect solution."

However… have being a customer of a very big competitor with 3-letters in their name for a very long time, I sadly had to ask for a refund, due to the hardware not being as advertised…. I am fighting that case as we speak… I went over to the Hetzner site that I had bought before maybe 10 years back and the value for money now is unbelievable…. Sure, I didn’t want to leave the “other” company just because of cash, it was more out of principle, but these specs and prices were insane. So I decided to speak to the web chat people at Hetzner as most companies dont list exact hardware like disk makes/models as they change… and this is really a big issue for me if I get something not suitable. The guy was the most helpful guy ive dealt with in this field. I spoke to him for a good 30 mins asking about what disk / models are in each server, discussing PCI Gen 3 / Gen 4 in servers and many more things other companies support desks couldn’t even tell me. I have since bought a server and the performance is amazing, the networks are amazing and i love the imageinstaller from the network rescue disk and how much you can config your own partitions etc. Obviously I haven’t used support yet… but in 20 years of running my own dedicated servers I only use support when there is a hardware issue or something is down in their network… Or in a recent case, the company sold me pc/laptops disks and (not Hetzner) said were server disks. I hope I don’t need to use support anyway, but all i can say was website pre-sales was best I have ever had… Server was delivered in maybe 3 minutes and price/performance beats all over company’s ive been looking at. ******* 3 Month Update ******** As I hoped I haven’t had to contact support about any issues. The hardware is rock solid and to be frank unreal spec and the network is super fast. I’m a bit of an IT nerd/lover so am always testing / benchmarking and the network/hardware network is literally is always 950mb/sec ++ both ways in real life tests…. which as the cards will never run much above that due to the network cards/cables etc… To me it says that when Hetzner tell you you get 1GB dedicated connection WAN and They actually deliver this. 5 stars again"

As luck would have it, hetzner does not try to contact you by any form other than email, further to this situation, I had the hetzner emails being redirected to a specific folder due to their marketing spam, which culminated in me missing the notifications. Further to this horrible situation, When I contacted accounts to resolve the outstanding payments, the lady I spoke to on the phone showed zero sympathy to the fact I had lost data and was clearly disappointed, even pointing out how I had outstanding bills I should have paid, despite the fact I explained how I would have sorted it on day one had I read the emails or been notified any other way."

Tyler Jenkins,CA,"Updated Jan 11, 2022",1,Absolutely braindead company with equally incompetent staff.,"Our server was purchased through an external provider who collaborated with Hetzner. Over the past 2-3 weeks, our server has been offline. Through our provider, we were able to find out that some random dude called Hetzner, asked them to change all of the credentials, to wipe the machine, and then to also delete all backups of the machine. Without any authorization. For some stupid reason, a braindead customer service rep completely broke security protocol and authorized everything without HAVING AUTHENTICATED ANY CREDENTIALS. THIS TOOK A WEEK TO FIND OUT. THE NEXT WEEK WAS SPENT WAITING FOR HETZNER TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE ANY FOLLOWUP WHICH THEY FAILED TO DO. They had to be poked and prodded only to say ""It's been escalated"" in response. In present day, I have NONE of my data, NO backups to restore to, NO access to the machine, AND RECEIVED ZERO COMPENSATION, because Hetzner STRAIGHT UP REFUSES TO PAY FOR AN ACCIDENT THAT ONE OF THEIR ABSOLUTELY STUPID, NO-LIFE EMPLOYEES CREATED. I am INCREDIBLY angry, I DO NOT recommend this service, and I hope Hetzner sees this and reviews this incident so that they DO NOT REPEAT IT. Additionally, I hope the service rep who caused this whole fiasco steps on a Lego brick so hard that it becomes PERMANENTLY LODGED in their foot. Screw you, Hetzner, screw you random guy, and screw you stupid customer service agent. E: ""What issue? I see no issue here!"" is what I would say if I did not wish to disclose the glaring security vulnerability. Here's the thing, Katie; your security team has no idea what happened because it NEVER WENT THROUGH THEIR HANDS. It was some random customer service agent who completely broke protocol. There was NO SECURITY TEAM INVOLVED and THAT is the issue. Regardless of that, the server is not under my name. Our provider had to deal with WEEKS of escalations. Multiple times we were told that Hetzner has ""no clue what happened"" until 2 weeks later someone finally spilled the beans. It is great that your security team ""couldn't find anything"", but if you read the review, it should be very obvious that I & my friend (whose name the server is under) both knew that already. There is no silly Uno Reverse card to pull out of your ass. This is your issue, an agent failed to follow protocol, and now I have NO DATA, NO BACKUPS, and NO COMPENSATION. Even if it was a provider fault, I still have received NOTHING but refusal on your end to admit the problem and act accordingly. I look forward to seeing how you respond to this. It better be good."

My tickets get resolved quickly, replies arrive few minutes or hours later, even on weekends or evenings. The dashboard is very clean looking, I would say it is the easiest I have ever used, while still having most of the features you will ever need. From what I heard, they are really strict on accepting new customers, but I did not experience any issues with that, but hopefully, they can adjust their automatic fake account detection in the future and avoid like 95% of the negative reviews they receive. I did not experience any attacks on my site, so I cannot comment on the protection and I do not break their rules, so I am not sure how quickly they terminate these malicious users, as many here try to defend themselves."

Edit on Hetzner reply: It seems that many real people were blocked too. From what I've seen I think you block people from specific countries and this is a very weird behavior. And whatever you want to explain here, the level of communication is very bad, nobody willing to help or answer. Dear potential customers, avoid this company and their behavior.

(hetzner.com, atw.hu, ovh.com) Unfortunately, the protection of contabo and yours ddos ​​is very poor. We run game servers on the leased service and a $ 10 booter can completely shut down the system. Be it minecraft, fivem, mtasa, csgo or web server, unfortunately you and hetzner are not properly protected. They get 2 stars because the prices are good and the hardware is what they provide. I think if you don't have an advanced DDoS protection at a service provider, you shouldn't indicate that you have it, because with so much power on a 10-line iptables that filters packets you could already say you have DDoS protection (With poetic exaggeration). I think this is completely misleading the buyer. It would be better for you to buy packages from different DDoS stresser sites and test them on various services such as game servers. You have recently (about 1-2 weeks) had a phenomenon where we have been attacked by a small amount of DDoS on our server and are still being blamed for not setting up adequate protection. A small amount of DDoS attacks hit our machine and there were hours of downtime due to it. Ready to joke. Then don’t write that you have protection because it’s a very rudimentary something. We used to leave you with 400-600 euros, but all the machines had to be moved due to inadequate protection. So only the backup storage machine is left there, but if that doesn't change it will also go into the soup. They lose a lot of customers because of this. Why not develop advanced ddos protection which would cost + per month but provide normal protection? I hope there will be a change in the near future. Thanks Roland"

You must do it from the customer panel you can not log into. Needless to say you cannot cancel the product. However Hetzner will keep billing your dedicated servers for 45-60 days after your due date. HEck. They turn you off on roughly day 45 apparently and bill you for 60. Every other webhost terminates service after 5 days max and begins the recycle process. Not these guys, they keep denying you access to the portal, continue to bill you, and then send a collections company after you. OH and the best part? The collections company wants about 25% more, they have some horrible exchange currency fees. They do claim the service is post-paid which is odd, because when you order, it collects your money up front. So in reality, the service is pre-paid but they always tack on an extra month of profit to cancellations. Extremely shady, but as a US citizen, I can find not any entity in Germany that will take a complaint because I am not a germen citizen. Now that I finished my billing rant. The network sucks, it is slow, you MIGHT see 50 mbps on the 1G connection, but don;t hold your breath. you often see 1-10 mbps. Support however says all is fine. UPDATE:9/13/21 Hetzner responded to my email and they demanded payment VIA Wire transfer only. So I need to spend $50 to send then $72. The funny part is their number is still not matching the collections agency which is over $100. This is a real SCAM here."

Niek Schoemaker,NL,"Jun 29, 2021",5,Great price and performance,"Been using OVH for as far as I can remember, decided to try Hetzner out for a bit and never looked back. The panel is really easy to use, VPS'es are a blast to setup (basically OVH managed VPS but for a normal price) and are accessible within 10 seconds. Dedicated servers take longer to get but that's understandable and it's something they are very open about, never had to wait longer than their ETA on dedicated servers. Have a 5950X with a 10 Gbit NIC running myself, runs around 70C and the bandwidth is really cheap."
Peter,CZ,"Updated Jun 29, 2021",5,Best hosting so far,This hosting is the best I ever had. I tried hostings like Zap hosting and this is the best. Why? Firstly they are extremely cheap. 11$ for 8gb ram and one of the best processors on the planet. Secondly you have like 14 days to pay it and you pay it every 4th day in month and like i said you have something like 14 days to pay it so i really love it. I run a hosting company on this and everyone who tried my service is happy :) Keep up the good work

I immediately entered my card details. They demanded a passport (I had never seen such a thing before). The next day, my account was approved. The administrator I hired got to work and performed his task perfectly. But just the next day I saw that my servers were not working and I could not log in to my account. I started looking for information on the Internet. And now I see how wrong I was when I chose hetzner. Because of these scammers, I lost about 800 usd (because I paid for a month of license for the program and hired an administrator). Besides, I've wasted a lot of time. Hetzner - the real scammers.

Network basically becomes unreachable randomly. I tried ubuntu 20.04 18.04 and arch linux and the problem just keeps happening. When I write to their support their only answer is that this is a software issue and they do not support software cases. I am pretty sure this is not a software issue because I created a vps for the time being on Digital ocean with also ubuntu 20.04 and no network issues whatsoever. So my advice is to keep far away from them unless you are buying a server for some personal project because one day you'll upgrade or something things will break and you will get no support and loose your clients due to constant problems

They replied ""the port is used by chia mining. A prior information was not possible."" So rhey couldnt send a simple mail beforehand neither ever after 10 days. They just don't care.

A.H.,GB,"May 22, 2021",5,Hetzner: A+ service,"Hetzner is, IMHO (and I've maintained servers online continuously since the early 1990s) the best of the best these days. We've been there four months at the time of this writing so prices might've changed, but we were able to provision a really fast ""bare metal"" machine with an unmetered fast Ethernet connection for around 70 pounds/month. Ryzen 9, dual enterprise NVMEs, 128MB of ram, for high-load needs this saved us a huge amount of money over cloud provisioning. We've had 100% uptime, zero problems since. We were moving back to our own dedicated servers and away from fast-provisioned scaling cloud containers due to the staggering cost increases in cloud hosting. While we distributed some servers at great deals globally, most cost us more per month to colocate (let alone the hardware/shipping costs) than the entire server rental/bandwidth package at Hetzner. And we didn't have to go through the time/expense of purchasing, outfitting and shipping equipment. So we decided to just keep the one at Hetzner Vs. installing our own server in Germany... Hetzner's documentation is thorough and easily found, the one question I did have was answered quickly, accurately and professionally. To me, as a woman in tech, basic politeness really matters..."

Thomas Williams,GB,"May 8, 2021",2,I was a customer of Hetzner for 9…,"I was a customer of Hetzner for 9 years, but have decided to leave today for a number of reasons. Over the 9 years, I've had many server products and generally, my experience has been OK. Hardware has been relatively stable, and uptime was decent. However, within the last year, I experienced a network issue within the data center (90% packet loss). The issue seemed to affect comms between a Hetzner router on the route back from their DC to the UK and was impacting customers on BT ISP and associated ISPs on the OpenReach network. I raised a ticket, and was advised the team it was forwarded to would reply Monday-Friday. This is ridiculous because the network is advertised as being managed and monitored 24/7. I sent a DM via Twitter to complain and was advised they try to maintain a healthy work life balance and the technicians that are on site need to be reserved ""to be doing very important and necessary work"". Given this was affecting routes back to the UK, I was very surprised to receive the comment about them being reserved for ""important and necessary work"". When they responded the following day, they tried saying that the issue was with my ISP however the issue was affecting traffic from Hetzner --> UK, not UK ---> Hetzner, so it was on a return path they choose that was having the issues. They changed the return path route which resolved the issue but continued to mention they have no influence on the incoming route, which is not where the issue was present (it gave me the impression they were trying to shift blame). I was dissapointed in the way this incident was handled. The server I purchased was unmanaged and I have always accepted responsibility for managing the software on my server as agreed. As part of this deal, it is my understanding that Hetzner are responsible for the hardware, and also the network. However, I felt they didn't held their end of the deal in this situation and didn't care either. Secondly, Hetzner are performing IBAN discrimination and prevent customers from the UK paying via SEPA because their IBAN starts with GB. This is illegal under Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 (irrespective of the fact the UK is no longer in the EU). I pointed out to them this was illegal but their position did not change. I urge anyone facing a similar issue to make a complaint to the The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority who are responsible for enforcing this. Finally, I tried setting up a new server order with Hetzner recently. I checked the service status page which provides a date your server will be setup. My server was not setup on the final advertised date and when I contacted them, they wanted additional business days. This wasn't acceptable to me at the time as resources had been put aside to perform the migration. I understand sometimes unexpected situations happen, but there are two things that I don't like here: 1) Firstly, you didn't contact me to mention there was a delay. I had to wait until the final day cut over and I had to contact you myself to find out what was going on. Why? 2) You set the expectation of your customers via your status page. You should factor in contingency into these dates to mitigate unexpected circumstances. I decided not to go ahead with the order due to the delay, and leave. The responses from Hetzner staff over the past few years seem to be getting more and more corporate and rude each day. I feel as a company they no longer understand their customers and I also get the impression they simply don't care. Given their inability to appreciate the impact of a 90% packet loss issue impacting UK visitors (along with the other issues mentioned) has made me lose complete confidence I can rely on them as a company when things go wrong. I held my end of the deal by managing my server within the agreement (not receiving a single abuse report within 9 years), but Hetzner seem to forget what they are responsible for. In summary, Hetzner are very cheap and competitive, but you should understand the risks to your servers when things go wrong. How Hetzner respond to these incidents concerns me and should concern anyone who is hosting servers that they are reliant upon. Even if you only host personal servers like I did, do you really want them to spend over a day before they even start looking at a 90% packet loss issue? The choice is yours."

I used their services for a short period of time, then decided to close my account. I was not informed of any outstanding balances before doing so. The next day I was sent an invoice for €7.54. The invoice states that the payment is due by PayPal. I only signed up for this company because they advertise as accepting payment by PayPal. When I click the link to pay the invoice however, it does not let me do so as my account is closed. The “support” team has been rude and absolutely unhelpful. They have informed me that I am unable to pay by PayPal because I closed my account. I have asked them to reinstate my account so that I can pay my invoice. They refuse to do this because my account has an outstanding balance. One of their e-mails to me stated the following: “As the account is disabled already, you have to make a bank transfer. There is no other option, and it's not our problem, you deleted your account, so disbaled it, before paying the invoice.” It’s not their problem? Are you serious? When I closed my account it didn’t show me an outstanding invoice. It didn’t give me any option to pay. I closed my account on March 31st at 12:02 PM. I was sent an invoice on April 1st at 4:14 AM. It seems to me like the problem is the way they run their system. They insist that I send an international wire transfer for €7.54 to them. I have repeatedly refused to send an international wire transfer where the fee to do so will cost me three or four times what I owe. After all, they clearly advertise that they accept PayPal. I have on multiple occasions offered to pay by credit card. I have also asked them for an e-mail address that I can simply send a PayPal payment to. They have refused both of these and insist that I send them a wire transfer. They are threatening to send me to a collections agency if I do not do so. This behavior borders on extortion. I am actually trying to pay my invoice, but they are NOT giving me a reasonable way to do so. Again when I asked to pay for PayPal, one of their replies states the following: “you don't have the option to do that as YOU deleted the account.” My last four e-mails to them asking them for a PayPal address to send payment to have been completely ignored. I suspect they will soon send me to a collections agency (as they have directly told me they will do this) for not paying my invoice, which I have repeatedly attempted to pay. I have NEVER dealt with a company with such rude and appalling customer service. I recommend avoiding this terrible company at ALL costs."

If you want to run non-essential apps/programs: they are cheap and have an usable interface.

Trustpilot advices: give some constructive criticism. Oke, here we go: Hetzner Support, please give support to your customers. At the very least, acknowledge that your customers exist.

Their Cloud CP is very easy to use, and their latest addition of a firewall only makes setting up new infrastructure easier. As for dedicated servers, the CP does look a little bit outdated style-wise but it still does it's job very well and their server auction is a good place to pick up a cheap server to do some testing on. I have not experienced any major outages in the time I have been hosting with Hetzner, and whenever I needed support I could count on them replying usually within an hour."

Abir Ahmed,BD,"Updated Apr 17, 2021",5,You get what you pay BUT read the terms...,"I've been a Hetzner client for more than a year now. I have an EX-42 server with them and ordered an AX-41 yesterday. I have never faced any downtime on a server, their network is stable, hardware performance is up to the job and calling their technical department (DC) resolves issues very quickly. There are many reviews here that indicates payment related issue or server deletion. I would like to say that I'm one of those clients who pays very late. My invoice generates on 3rd of every month but I often pay them at 19th or 20th of that month. I receive multiple invoice emails and in the pdf it indicates the last day to pay as well. Terms and conditions are there for a reason, if we fail to follow the terms, it's only our fault ;) In my opinion, no server is stable for people who are running business without any Server expertise or have their own system administrator. Hiring an expert would change their mind once the server is configured correctly. The control panel is easy enough to navigate around. While I have to wait for KVM, it's understandable given the low price range. It doesn't take more than an hour for a KVM to be attached to the server once requested. But I do love the fact that I can just call the DC technician directly and communicate with them about any problems regarding my server. At the end of the day, no hosting company is perfect. But Hetzner does a very good job given the relatively low price range of their servers."

Such ignorance in dealing with customer data is unacceptable from a service provider providing business critical infrastructure. I DO NOT recommended choosing Hetzner for even a small startup not even a bigger company, if they can delete customer business without putting any effort in resolving a very basic issue. UPDATE: How Hetzner actually deleted the server: April 9, Friday, 19:45 - send an email to customer informing that the automatic payment has failed April 10, Saturday, 09:01 - lock the account April 12, Monday, 09:56 - delete the account and all stored data One warning, total ignorance.

Unlike providers like OVH, Hetzner actually gets back to you promptly when submitting tickets regarding eg. KVM access or replacement of defective hardware. Right now I got an AX41-NVME and the performance for the price is absolutely great for my personal use. I can see there is plenty of negative reviews here regarding the billing, but again most of the people have not read the term they agreed to when signing up for the service. Just stopping to pay a bill is not seen as a cancellation and I doubt they would do the same with eg. utility bills - if you pay on time there is nothing to be worried about at all and even if you want to cancel it is 1 click away within the Hetzner billing portal. I would recommend Hetzner to others for sure and I have absolutely no complaints regarding the service."

I guess cheap services come with a huge price tag in the end. I'd rather look for an expensive alternative. You can't be banning people without warning or notification. Not everybody is a criminal.

Hendrik Demir,NL,"Updated Mar 15, 2021",5,One of the best hosting companies I've ever worked with,"I am shocked to see how many bad reviews this company has received in the past. I was recommended to take a look at Hetzner a week ago by one of my friends as I was looking for a good and affordable dedicated server. On a first glimpse, Hetzner's pricing looks amazing. They were one of the cheapest companies that one can find when comparing it to other providers, especially when you look at what you receive in return. They do charge a set-up fee which almost matches the monthly cost of your server, but that's fine. I also like that their prices don't change depending on how long you choose to work with them, someone that wants a server for a month pays the same monthly price as someone that wants a server for a year. At first I was a bit worried about their ""verification"" system, but it was fairly simple and quick. They have two options: one where you put 20 bucks on your account and one where you send them your documents. I first went with sending my documents, but since it was a manual process, I switched to putting 20 bucks on my account, as it is a bit faster. My account was immediately verified and I was able to order a server. Now, Hetzner has a page where you can find how long your order will take to finish. This was approximately 4 to 5 workdays when I ordered my server, but I already received it on Monday (ordered on Friday). To quickly summarize: I can genuinely recommend Hetzner to anyone looking for a reliable hosting provider with good pricing. They are fast, have amazing customer service (which is reachable from 6:30AM to 6:00PM) and have amazing prices. I have yet to experience the stability of their servers (for instance any downtime) and will update my review in a month. Also, I've learned a valuable lesson here: reviews regarding a hosting provider will never give you an actual ""score"" of the company. As you can see in the reviews, most are about the verification process of Hetzner which they created to prevent their servers from being used by bad people. You might have to wait a day or two to get verified, but what you get in return, is most certainly worth it. I hope to keep working with Hetzner and am grateful for what they've done for me so far."
Blue Softec,EG,"Mar 13, 2021",1,very bad support,I asked to change my server IP and hetzner team did it with extra fees but since this moment everything is down and I can't reach my server and hetzner team answered my support tickets that everything is works but it doesn't true I can't reach anything on my server and Hetzner team do not want to check this problem or do their work completely and want me to resolve this problem myself technically despite it is their work to make everything running again on the new IP
dr. sc. Mate Kosor,HR,"Mar 10, 2021",1,"Great for hobby, but not for critical business","They have great prices, give you extras (like storage for backup, private network, dns) and have decent admin panel. But if you hit their abuse triggers they will cut you off without explanations. They do not provide any explanation about what you did wrong. You have no grace period to get your data off their machines. They don't send you notice. Imagine you set up your web service, and after some time, suddenly customers start calling. You try to log in and there is no access. Upon email to their support you get few bare words and no explanations. You are left scrambling to set up your service again somewhere else. That happened to me. I hope they change their approach to customers. I understand that they can choose who to work with, but doing so in such an erradic manner will drive the legitimate business away. Right now they are not dependable."

I see that my server is not available and I cannot log into my account. The last opportunity to find out what is the reason is to write to technical support via mail. I wrote, but there is no answer. Now I see that there are a lot of people with this problem. Therefore, I regret that yesterday I wasted my day off on this terrible hosting, and today, on a holiday (in Russia today is a holiday not a working day), I will spend one more day to go to another hosting.

But their VPS’s aren’t just VPS’s. They are cloud VPS’s means they are billed by the hour and have features like load balancing and block storage. All that flexibility for that little price for a cloud based environment is really amazing. I have been using both, but using the dedicated for more time. The pricing is really good for what it is, and I may seem to upgrade soon as as of writing this comment they have a 5950x for 120€.

Ok fine, created a second account just an individual one, provide photos of my driver's license, front and back, and 24 hours later, no response, no access to my second account. My advice, they are not worth the headache. They don't have any integrity nor do they know what true customer service is. They can use the excuse they get spammer and scammers, people don't pay bills, etc but it's all lies. Hosting companies, very big companies at that, all over the world don't even require proof of business registration or scan/photo of ID's and they are still in business doing much more business than Hetzner. Save yourself time, use Digital Ocean, OVH, SoYouStart, even GoDaddy is better than this company.

Virtualization is KVM!!! My Linux machines performance is excellent, no latency, no bottleneck. (i am changed couple hosting providers, they are using VmWare and its terrible) 3.

If your servers or business is clear and there is no fraud or security incidents then nobody will close your account and delete your data!!! Only one minus -> there is no default OpenSUSE image :) how?

After 10+ emails, it was clear that they were not going to give access to my account, so I paid in bank transfer and told them to disable my account as I did not want any further business with them. After I paid it, they claimed it was disabled, and I thought that would be the last time I heard from them. A few weeks later, I got an email claiming I owed them more money, even after I had paid their fees and $100 extra for the bank transfer fee. This time, I did not want to pay via bank transfer because I did not want to pay $130 for a $30 charge. I went back and forth with them hoping to get another method so I could pay them and be done with them forever, but they demanded I continue to pay them in bank transfer. I am debating what to do now as they continually charge me for transactions I do not authorize. I'm currently waiting for another reply from the customer support team confirming I do not owe them any more money and that this will be the last time I ever need to deal with their company. Their services may be cheap, but it is not worth the headache that you get from dealing with their customer support. The amount of extra money I have spent and the amount of hours I have wasted due to their incompetence makes their cheap prices completely worthless. You save more money by using more reputable services and less sketchy companies. Do yourself a favor, don't choose Hetzner and choose a company that cares about its clients. Ticket #2020100803016872"
Aleksandr,UA,"Oct 17, 2020",1,Really worst hosting provider ever.,Really worst service ever. We run (still but now switching to another provider) several dedicated servers with load balancer together. Load balancers crashed 3 times in 2 days. Hetzner people don't even respect their clients. They proposed 10 euros for such an inconvinience. They don't care that we lost a lot of our cliens. Don't lose your time with such a company.
Х. С.,GB,"Updated Oct 16, 2020",1,Cannot believe how terrible Hetzner actually IS.,"Okay, here is a honest review from a person, who uses few different networks for Game Servers and Websites. Hetzner has a damn good price when it comes to Dedicated machines and Cloud servers no doubt. When I made a request to their staff team i was gobsmacked, it IS terrible and by terrible i mean 98% of them don't actually have an idea what customer care actually is. You should be ashamed really, what is what i can say. I am a customer of a Bulgarian datacenter, where they use Voxility as their DDoS protection, which (not always detects an attack), but in order for them to solve my issues they have enabled always on mode on Voxility DDoS protection for my ip. I recently asked Hetzner about this, they have responded that there is NO WAY they can do that, because technical things. Dude... who do you think ur talking to? I get it you think your customers are stupid right, like there is no way for me to go into arbor's website and check that with every service they offer always on mode for their protection. Bottom of the line, use Hetzner ONLY for educational purposes. e.g. when your make yourself a website and want to see what an actual system administrator faces when trying to deflect DDoS. Your sensor mode setting suck hard... no joke there is no normal ddos protection, which takes 15 minutes to define traffic as malicious. 15 minutes?!. DO NOT USE Hetzner!!! As soon as i find a provider other than OVH (which i get DDoS-ed internally) i will change providers. Poor support. State of the nonsense DDoS protection. False advertising. Shady network management practices. Arbor is not a terrible DDoS protection, your incompetent network engineers team makes it to be that. Ticket#2020101303005721 Thats all on Hetzner's services for now."

They don't even send a message that the server (or accounts) is disabled. Like many others, i started the server, and the next day I got the error - account disabled. I DID NOT (!!!) get any notifications in my email. I was just confronted with a fact. My situation is very similar to one of the last reviews. My account was also blocked, and I CAN NOT even DOWNLOAD the DATA that was left on hetzner's servers!!! I wrote to support, but no one has answered me for several days. I don't know the reason why the block was made. I'm not interested. With this attitude to the client, I do not want to use this hosting, and the price does not matter. Hetzner, what prevents you from simply disabling Internet access on the server, or giving time for a client to download their data and leave you for another hosting service? It's sad that I didn't read the reviews before registering my hetzner account."

During registration, the hosting asked me for the card details to write off the verification amount. Then it asked for documents. I sent them too. Everything is successful, the account is ready to go. I bought a program that I wanted to use on the hosting. The license of the program is tied to HWID (I tied it to the Hetzner servers). I hired a freelancer to help me set up the servers. Wasted money and time. I started everything. The next day I try to log into the Hetzner account and see an error: ""account disabled."" What happened? Why is my account disabled? I have given you all the data. (card and passport) Why were there no notifications? I asked these questions to support of Hetzner via email. But nobody answers me. As a result, I was left without money, without servers, and I also cannot download my data. I can't transfer the purchased program to another hosting! If the hosting (hetzner) didn't like me for some reason, why weren't there any notifications? Why don't you give me time to transfer my data to another hosting? Why aren't you answering emails? Disgusting attitude towards the client!"

Hetzner allows their servers to be resold. We currently run around 60 customer servers. Sometimes we receive abuse reports from Hetzner, because sometimes customers distribute copy-protected content. But we also get Abuse reports for server ip's which was not assigned to our Hetzner account. Anyway in our terms and conditions, we expressly point out to our customers that we do not tolerate the distribution of copy-protected content and that it is expressly prohibited! In the case of an abuse report by Hetzner, we immediately suspend the corresponding server acceess. The server traffic is completely blocked. By the way we sometimes get Abuse reports for Server where the in and out traffic which was blocked by the Hetzner Firewall. This situation makes us think how reliable are the abuse reports that were sent to us by Hetzner by mail. From a legal point of view, for a valid copyright infrigment a letter must be issued by the local court. Which is unfortunately not the case with Hetzner. Anyway we forward the Hetzner Abuse Report to our customers, we also demand the clients to remove the corresponding copy-protected content immediately. We make mention of, that just only a few such cases. Regardless, Hetzner informed us by email that our account would be canceled at the end of November and all servers are automatically schedule to termiante to that date. This irresponsibly act of Hetzner towards its customers. In addition, this action brings unreliability towards Hetzner. We have a responsibility towards our honest customers, this irresponsible behavior by Hetzner leaves us embarrassed and in trouble with our client. Hetzner really has to work on how they deal with their business partners. They have to see the major customers as partners and work better with them. Here the original Text: Dear Mr XXXXXXX, Thank you for having chosen Hetzner Online GmbH as your webhosting partner. We appreciate the trust you have placed in us. Unfortunately, there are a number of issues with your account. This includes, but is not limited to, abuse complaints for your servers, and poor reputation of your IPs. As a result of this, your account KXXXXXXXXXXX and all services you have with us are going to be cancelled. The cancellation is being done in accordance with our Terms and Conditions (https // www hetzner . com/rechtliches/agb/). The official cancellation date is the end of next month, November 30th, 2020. If you would like to cancel the servers to an earlier date you are welcome to do so via your client webinterface. If by the end of this month any dedicated servers have not yet been scheduled for cancellation, we will automatically schedule them for cancellation to the end of next month. If we detect further abuse from your servers, then they will be blocked and not unblocked. Please make sure all abusive activities are completely prohibited and that there won't be any more issues.

Moiz Izzy,IN,"Updated Oct 11, 2020",5,Hetzner provides super fast servers at economical prices and amazing support,"To be honest I had a dedicated server with hetzner and because I wanted to diversify my cloud hosting I tried aws azure and even linode and do but no one and I mean it literally no one could match the speed of the hetzner servers and the hetzner servers take it to the next level with its pricing. But even if you ignore that they are more economical their servers are just much faster due to the NVME drives and the better CPU. The one disadvantage though is that they don’t have as many Datacenter as some of the other guys, but I came back to hetzner after months of evaluating everyone else. Also they provide complete flexibility on what you want to run and have OS images that you can link to when you set up a new dedicated or cloud server. Their new load balancers are super cool and you can even balance you traffic between dedicated and cloud servers using the lb, how cool is that. And to top it off I was not expecting this but their support is very good, there are probably better support models in the market. But I have never had a critical reason to chat with support (that in itself talks about their reliability) but the few times I wanted some kvm attached or pen drive attached they were just super quick and friendly and to be honest this makes a difference you could have the best servers in the world but without a good support team serious clients will leave. Speaking from a bad experience I had before I came to hetzner.. but been with them for over 3 years now and it’s by grace of god been amazing"

When choosing Hetzner to host your important projects, remember this from their T&C's: ""9.2 The contract is cancellable without giving reasons by both parties at any time during a period of 30 days to the end of the month, but at the earliest on expiry of the minimum contract period stipulated in the contract. "" So Hetzner can cancel all your servers 1 day before they are due to renew. This could give you 24 hours or less to move to another service provider. They could notify you at 3AM, on a Sunday, or on Christmas Day. So only trust Hetzner with websites/apps/services where you are able to move everything within 24 hours.

From simple company web sites, to full turnkey solutions and database information systems. Quality hosting is number one priority for us, and we found that in Hetzner. The primary products we use at Hetzner are dedicated servers, with some secondary use of cloud. Vast selection of hardware, from very cheap desktop grade machines, to quality enterprise grade Xeons and AMD, for quite affordable prices. Cloud offering is in its beginnings (compared feature-wise to other public clouds), but evolves steadily. The ""Serverborse"" auctioning of older machines is perhaps unique to Hetzner (haven't seen a similar offer in EU) and though old, at least Xeon grade servers are high quality and (re)usable in enterprise. Network is stable, power is stable, the only uptime busting happens when we reboot for kernel upgrades. Tech support responds reasonably fast, they're skilled and helpful. We only have positive experience with Hetzner, we have no complaints or plans to look for another provider and we recommend their services to anyone needing anything from hobby hosting through professional, enterprise grade hosting where it's critical part of your business."

How cool is that. It also hosts my websites on it without any problems. The network is super reliable. as we're located in the netherlands the ping is pretty good. 25 ms where i'm located.

I wanted to try their cloud offering and literally could not believe what i was seeing. I created a 2 core instance just for trial. And bam, there it is a few seconds later. I SSH in literally within 10 seconds and there it is waiting for me. The main French company it can take upto 5 minutes to get an instance and log in details, the smaller company is about a minute, so this was impressive. Now from point of logging in to having Pritunl up and running was less than 5 minutes. Everything was just so fast, from getting updates to installing, i dont think i saw a single percentage done symbol anywhere. Seriously impressed i came here just to write a review. And lastly, at last a control panel that is fresh looking easy to navigate, fast and has a wealth of info.

After the discussion she told me that will unblock the account only after they will receive the money. Strangely enough, after the call my account was unblocked and I can see the transaction in the balance section, even stranger that the transaction date is 9 July which is 11 days ago. My question is : Why did you blocked my account if you had the money? P.S. Blocking the account on Friday when you know that you don't have any support causing loses for you clients and not having support 24/7 it's ridiculous."
Akam,IQ,"Updated Jul 19, 2020",2,Strange Policy regarding Network Packet,"I just purchased a dedicated server, the hardware was very good and the customer support was very quick. But they confused me with very strange thing, they suddenly blocked my Server and they told me that there was some packets from my server with different MAC address, lol, this is just happening in any environment, there might be millions of traffic from any server and when using VPN to connect to your server then the MAC will be visible, and all those packets because of bad Network configuration, and they told me to cancel my order then I just did it. I think Hetzner is very Good Company and Legit, but they can't grew because they don't know how to deal with the market and how to satisfy their customer. Currently, I have around 10 servers, and 10 VPS in different places, its the first time that someone tell me that my server sent packets which was not allowed, I asked for help but they didn't helped me, I also told support team that I authorize them to login to my server but still no luck. That's it, when IT Security playing a big role it will cause other business side to down, and when there is no security then a big lose will happen, there must a balance between Security and Business all the time to prevent revenue loss."

But they don't have any response whatsoever. I don't know if I can ever trust this company who just ask for a personal data from you (in this case ID/passport) then afterwards once they get it, poof they will deny you access. Furthermore, I'm not sure about what they are going to do with that passport which I can't remove from their site and which is already a privacy issue on my part. One advice I can give for persons who is looking for hosting, STAY AWAY from this company. Don't give them your ID whatsoever. If I can give this company a zero star, I have done it already :("

It has cloud features, though I'm not a cloud user because what I do is low-end but I'm sure it's enough for bigger customers. It has a really nice and clean UI, and it's been a breeze to use it compared to my ex-host OVH (ovh's panel loads so slow, and you can't migrate easily sandbox instance and many more cons) For low-end it's probably the best price you can get higher up it's very competitive too It is somewhat of a cloud (at least for vpses no experience with bare-metal): supports rescaling, has it's own API, optional private network for communication between servers, daily backups for +20% of price (7 slots), volumes, snapshots (cross-server!), floating ips and recently added load balancers (in beta), also you can create an instance with your ssh key instantly set. 20TB of traffic/?instance?

Claudia,MX,"Updated Jun 18, 2020",1,Incredible bad UX,"Incredible bad UX, waiting for the setup of the server and instead informing me about something, they block simply my account, without any information to give me the possibility to react and order somewhere else. After reading the other UX, I found that: "" Reply from Hetzner Online GmbH Jun 8, 2020 Our team did not tell you the reason for your account's rejection on purpose. It is our policy not to tell customers the reason. Why...? We find that being less transparent about our processes for account authentication actually helps us to prevent abuse more effectively. (If scammers/spammers know more about our processes, it is easier for them to try to work around them.) Our past experience has shown that the more transparent we were in the past about our decisions, the more abuse we had shortly afterwards. So we made a concious decision that preventing abuse was more important. We completely understand and accept that some potential customers may choose to go to our competitors instead. Our low prices attract a lot of suspicious customers. And we have a responsibility to prevent abuse however we can. Our experience shows that being overly careful and having some false positives during the account verification process is very effective. This is why I will not tell you why our order was rejected. Please do not be offended. We do not tell anyone this information. We are simply trying to act as a responsible company and keep others on the Internet safe. There are dozens and dozens of variables for what might make a new order look suspicious. But it certainly does not depend on the colour of your skin whether someone gets an account with us. Also we accept customers from all around the world.. Some countries are rated with a higher risk, but we do not reject orders based only on countries. There are occassionally things in people's account information that look unusual, even if they are accurate. So you might think we are a bit too careful, but actually we are trying to be responsible. --Helena, Marketing"" Funny part is 3 years back I rented server from Europe with a Europe Bank. How I'm a digital nomad, now I'm in latin america with a card from another latin country. So instead to ask to identify myself, their politics is simply f*@k colateral damage, f@*ck false positive. There was a time I was glad to use Hetzner, this expirience was so terrible (I needed a server right now and was waiting for there email, and a day later I figure out that they blocked my account as ""false positive"". Rediculous and disrespectful! Edit: ""Please do not take a rejection personally. We are not saying that you are distrustful. We are not saying that you are a scammer."" It's not about a rejection, I don't care. Still you are free to choose your customers as far as I know and I'm free to choose whom I contract for my services. ""we are actually trying to be responsible."" You caused harm. I had a productive vserver (not from hetzner) which was somehow defektive, to fix the problem right I intented to switch to a bare metal server and not lose time. How me and my husband used long ago a lot servers from hetzner and they was fast we went straight to hetzner. I was even talking with the support chat because in Helsinki it was 17:50 and I thought there will nobody work anymore. I asked him after ordering a EX-42-NVMe if it would be faster to order a one from the server auction. First he dind't want to tell me, but finally he told me better to take one of the SB. So I wrote a ticket to cancel the EX in favor of the SB because I need the server as soon as possible. So I was waiting for ""few minutes to 1 work day"" while my customers had issues. It had be so easy to tell simple ""We Don't want you as customer, please get some non-discriminating provider"", but you choose to let me in the belief that soon the server will be ready (I max expected an email asking for my Passport and proof of residence). But NOT ONE E-MAIL to inform me to enable me to take immediate action. Next afternoon, your morning still nothing, try to look in the robot: ""Your account as been blocked"". This is exactly ""trying to be responsible"" but NOT responsible. Heise is not trustful, and one of this companies which makes it really hard for digital nomads. If you one of them better stay away from hetzner! ""Try to Re-do your order."" Certainly not! You was not able to send not even a email, except here where it is about your reputation. What makes you thinking that I would ever want to do business with you after this experience? I will also never ever advise my customers to purchase servers from hetzner. ""Your order may still be rejected despite you re-doing it."" :D I don't understand this culture, jump through X-loops and make this tricks and we will consider if we will be willing to grant you...

Everything is fast and the management interface for the cloud servers is very modern. The dedicated servers are rock solid, but the management Interface a bit dated. Technical support is always quick and helpful. I almost never need them, but when i need them they answer within an hour. The accounting team is a pain in the butt. You usually don’t need to talk to them because invoicing and payment is automatic, but when you do you only get half answers at best. Which is frustrating. To end positive: what I like is that they don’t flood you with useless marketing e-mail. I tried DigitalOcean and they sent me daily e-mail about discovering “everything in my account“ for a week. Hetzner just let’s you install your server and gets out of your way. No upsell or useless marketing. They do have a newsletter but it’s low frequency and neutral informative."

In truth when you add up the hardware and electricity costs, they are seriously well priced; in truth no other bare metal server providers even come close. My only gripe would be that it takes 3 working days for the server to be setup, and you have to pay 100% extra setup fee. However if you purchase a server from the auction then you dont have these fees and waits."

I went on and cleared said invoices via Paypal. After this, I received a notification to say If those invoices were not cleared my account would be canceled. As I had made the payments in advance of receiving this, I didn't take action. Hetzner canceled my account and deleted 2 servers immediately, causing us to lose work. I rang the accounts team to discuss the issue and attempt to reactivate our account. When I explained my situation, the member of the billing team lost her temper, spoke over me, raised her voice, and became quite argumentative. I had to ask her to stop being rude on the phone. The customer service was very disappointing and now we have made payments against time periods servers were not provided for."

We now have 5 dedicated and some cloud servers running there, never had any unprecedented issues so far. Yes, if you order an unmanaged server, you have to do everything or you have to pay for the remote hands. It's not a secret. Their network is very reliable, the datacenter colleagues are also top, should it be replacing a dead SSD or migrating servers. And what's also important: the pricing is solid and plannable. I do find the server-setup costs a bit high, there could be an option to contract with for more than 12 months without (or lower) setup fee."

Y.V.,CH,"Updated May 7, 2020",5,I grew up with hetzner and saw hetzner changing over years... in good way =),"Hey there! I literally grew up using hetzner services since I was teenager and saw company changing over years, implementing more stuff, new datacenters and even unlimited bandwidth, so no more between 20 and 50 TB traffic (depending on server model) and after 1eur per TB. And fancy hardware you had as well back in days =) Anyway, I think Hetzner became a reliable and professional partner, which is continuously improving. This is something super important, not every company has this. For example I worked for quite long time with LeaseWeb and they are not so bad, but at one moment they took another road for some reason (something like 6 years ago), which forced me and my customers moving their services elsewhere. I suggest Hetzner to everyone, to my customers, colleagues, companies where I'm working, including my current company, and you know what, everyone are quite satisfied. One thing regarding support, I saw that many people are unhappy about support and the only thing I will say, is that all departments are trying to improve as much as possible, after all, we all human beings. As the last thing, thank you Hetzner! :-)"

Vladyslav,UA,"May 5, 2020",1,Strongly not recommend this company,"Strongly not recommend this company and any service to use. All started from the new year. My credit card got expired and I wasn't able to update my payment info due to personal circumstances. I was using the cheapest vps server. Each reputable company will inform the user about expired card info and will simply shut down the server and allow the user to update their own profile. Hetzner instead, was sending invoices from month to month after card expiration, for the service that shouldn't be paid. Disabling your personal account along the way, so you won't be able to update information about your credit card! But they will continue sending you invoices... Answering simply ""you have the only one option to pay - via bank/wire"". And threatening to spread your information to debt collectors. So, Hetzner, take into account that you have customers, who live outside the EU, where making a bank/wire payment to the EU is really difficult. You can simply allow your customers enter their profile, update payment info in two clicks and that's all. Looks simple. But no. You're forcing your customers to do the things that look abnormally. It's not fair. You're forcing your customers to pay for the period when user can't do anything, even login to his account. You're thinking only for your earnings, not to be at least a good cloud provider. After that, when you've received money for this s**tty period, your customer support asks, whether they should reactivate your account. Of course you should. Just to allow your customers to log into their account and allow them to delete their profile itself, just to forget about your services. And then after a few requests to reactivate your account, customer service answer: ""as a gesture of goodwill we reactivated your account for you so you can place new orders"". What the f**king gesture of goodwill? You're forcing and threatening your customers and then you say something about a gesture of goodwill. And information for everyone, note that after account remove, which user performed by himself, account hasn't been completely removed. You'll hear from customer service that ""Your account is blocked and the data is only stored because we are legally obliged to keep this data."" So I don't recommend doing business with this company. Their philosophy is based only on financial profit, not being at least good company."

Today I decided to remove that supplement cause I didn't need it anymore. So when Hetzner Support claimed to removed the NIC the server was not reachable via Putty or via my NGINX website on it. The answer I got was that ""You have to go via KVM console and fix the network settings"". It was a very cryptic answer and as always, it seems like Hetzner support got a pre-written script cause you get almost the same answer every time. I answered that, how do I do that then? And I got the other dumb answer they LOVE to send to the client in help ""Check out Hetzner wiki och forum"". And, no. Hetzner Wiki or Forum don't have any guide how to fix the internet setup. It's really disappointing, because if I order a supplement to my server and then want it to be cancelled. I foresee that my server will work as before after I cancelled the supplement. It's like you force me into have the NIC forever. And you guys couldn't even tell me how to fix it, but theoretically, you guys caused it. This is really disappointing and I can say that my servers from you guys will get cancelled very soon. Same on you!"

At the moment you get +2 abuse reports (legit or not), because maybe you're reselling hosting and had the back luck to get abusers signing up to your site. you become to be threated as a enemy instead of a customer, also you have to write long and annoying statements for everything including any small DOS attacks. And at the end of the day that doesn't guarantee nothing, because if they don't accept your explanations or you get constant abuse tickets (who doesn't? if you handle 500+ customers) them you get your ip blocked or better they just close your account and you lose EVERYTHING.

rossiscool123,GB,"Feb 18, 2020",5,"For dedicated servers, you cant beat them","Been using Hetzner for around 3 months after switching from a VPS from Contabo (Good VPS provider for dirt cheap prices) I was very shocked that you could order a server without a deposit or anything and use it for 14 days risk free which is what I did for a few weeks since I had issues migrating and didn't feel like paying over 100 euro for 4 days wasted. This is very good if you want to test them out without paying upfront. However I do feel like this could be exploited for hosting illegal content and using their bandwidth for DDoS attacks. Either way I would highly recommend them if you need a stupid amount of storage, they range from as little as 512 NVMe all the way to 16TB of HDD storage. Just be aware that if you have any software issues they provide no support whatsoever for it, only networking and hardware issues, so if you're a novice Linux user like me and break something you're in the dark my friend."

Everything you may need to configure on your server or its network can be done over the web interface.

I'd say among the best prices in Europe as opposed to what you get. I'm currently paying for the ""CCX21"" package. Priced at € 43.63 with 25% VAT included. It's a cloud instance that comes with 4 vCPU at 1.0 GHz each. 16 GB RAM, 160 GB disk space and 20TB traffic. My instance is located in their Finland DC. Excellent speeds to Sweden. My experience so far has been good, not great. No downtime, fast I/O and connection speeds. What I don't like is the low amount of computing power you get. Competitors offer more for the same price. I also don't like that you can't tailor your instance. You are forced to upgrade to another package all together. Something I really don't like is setup fees for dedicated servers. Charging a setup fee for provisioning is part of the ""old days"". In reality this process is almost 100% automated for Hetzner. I'd rather see a few euros extra per month instead of setup fee. I have decided to give a rating of 4 out of 5."

Dong Ha Kim,US,"Updated Sep 6, 2019",5,Hetzner Online has absolutely been a stellar host.,"I am a user of their EX42 line of servers, which are both extremely affordable given the performance of the hardware. I have found so far that no other host offers this level of performance at this price point. Honestly, I wonder how Hetzner can even turn a profit from renting out their servers at such a low price. I heard concerns that the network and peering of Hetzner are not good, but as far as my experience goes, Hetzner's network was pretty robust and I didn't notice any weird packet loss or bandwidth problems with it. I also didn't notice any overselling on their network, almost all of the time the performance was as advertised. And on top of that, Hetzner's dedicated servers come with unlimited/unmetered 1Gbit speeds. I can't say anything about their DDoS protection because I use a CDN. I tried servers in Germany and Finland, but speaking from experience, the German locations have better 'global' routing. Hetzner's support has a very fast response time, usually, I get a response from them within 30 minutes or less. The support staff was very informed and competent, and also offered solutions to problems pretty quickly. They also ask for confirmation before doing any configuration change on my servers. The tone they use to write their emails does come off as a bit cold, they get to the point without any fluff. Still, as they get their job done quickly I don't have any problems with this. Of course, when renting a dedicated server from Hetzner it is important to note they do not provide support on anything that can't be solved on their end (aka software). Hetzner's support strictly adheres to this 'dedicated server = no software support' principle is probably what angers some new unsuspecting users coming from a managed server. For me, I was expecting this to hold true (because I am paying for a dedicated server, not managed server) so I didn't have any unpleasant surprises. New users of Hetzner MUST note that dedicated servers, by definition and industry practices, do not come with the same level of support as you would expect from a managed server. Still, some other providers are a bit lenient about this–they will help with a bit of Linux/Windows networking configuration–despite the customer using a dedicated server from them, so if I HAD to suggest a point of improvement this would be it. Oh, their Robot interface (or panel?) used to administer their Dedicated Servers could use a visual upgrade. It does get the job done and is reasonably snappy but for first-time users, I think it is a bit hard to navigate. They updated their Cloud interface to make it look modern, so I hope they do the same thing for their Robot interface as well."

Simon Hoff Kunze,DK,"Sep 4, 2019",5,Best hosting provider on the planet!,"Best hosting provider on the planet. I've been a customer at Hetzner for nearly a decade, both as a private individual, for my business and for my clients, and I've used several of their available products including VPS and dedicated servers. Their customer service is without exception a sublime experience, very quick response times and concise communication. This applies to both phone and email support. Online interfaces for managing products works like a charm and are easy to use. Their documentation/wiki is also a great source of information. Prices are very low, so low that I cannot comprehend how they can offer such high level of quality and service. Hosting providers with comparable service levels often charge 5 to 10 times more for the same product. Newsletters are rare but great in the sense that the information is always relevant to stay up to date. Also in case of changes/maintenance/migration that may affect you as a customer the communication is concise and timely. I can wholeheartedly recommend Hetzner as the only hosting provider you'll ever need, at least as long as their locations in Germany or Finland are relevant to your needs."
sensadvert,MK,"Aug 29, 2019",5,Excellent choice!,"Hello, this is our first time with Hetzner and for a while we were analyzing all the specs, especially for their VPS and must say - excellent. The price is great compared to our current hosting provider. We are working since 2012 and already have made many sites hosted on our VPS, but they increased the prices too much and on the other hand, our server started failing lately. Especially in situations when some of our customers publish announcement and draw attention to maybe 50 users on his website, then the entire server is going down and starts to choke. Interestingly, even a month ago we had virtually the same number of users with the same requests as now and everything was fine. But a week ago all the problems started. And all of a sudden we started receiving offers from our host to upgrade the server. We wouldn't go into why this is happening, but we definitely decided to migrate. Today we have had urgent situation with one website for online ticket sales and we have just ordered level 4 shared package from Hetzner. Given the short time... (the website is going live officially tomorrow) we just bought this shared hosting to make this website available for tomorrow (on the previous hosting we almost wasn't able to edit the page). After registration at Hetzner we were asked to provide proof for our company (our registered certificate). No matter what the document is issued in a foreign language, Hetzner responded very quickly ~5min and our account was approved. Their user interface - konsoleH is fast and pretty much easy to use. After dns propagation we can say that our website is literally flying. The speed and all the tests we have done are excellent. Next month we are starting with their manged VPS and we are moving all the accounts with them. We believe that we re going to have positive experience with that also. Thanks"

Liam,GB,"Updated Aug 21, 2019",1,I have never seen such a poor provider.,"I have never seen such a poor provider. I've been a customer with Hetzner for over a year, with invoices ranging from €400-€600 each month. I had been leasing over 8 dedicated servers, mostly used for game servers, every time a DDoS attack is launched the game server disconnects for a few seconds, and I have to reconnect, this happens at least 5-7 times a day. When contacting Hetzner for support, I'm simply told to ""google how to set up a firewall"". I've spent hundreds hiring sysadmins to implement firewall rules on both the server and in the Hetzner control panel. Regardless of what I added or changed, the issue still remains to this day which Hetzner will still not assist me with. I highly do not recommend Hetzner, hence why i'm moving providers. EDIT 21/08/2019: It hasn't got anything to do with managed or unmanaged servers. Hetzner state on the website that the i9 servers are recommended for game hosting, and have DDoS Protection. But how can the servers be recommended for game hosting if whenever a DDoS attack is launched the server disconnects? I have already had system network engineers take a look at your firewall system, and this firewall didn't block any UDP flooding on my server. I would've taken your offer to have an admin take a look, but the last reply I got on my ticket was ""I am sorry to inform you that we can not be familiar with every protocol arround in the internet."" This is not how you talk to a customer, hence why i've already switched over to a new provider. Thank you for reaching out though."

Anyway the story continues; this one will give you problems and extra++++ invoices! I've never had such bad experience with a hosting company before; the servers, knowledge of the staff and accounting is overall seriously bad! For instance they have the sale out section where you can rent cheap servers but ohh you cannot run vmware on it because the hardware doesn't support it, so you have to slipstream drivers within a cd and place it somewhere where you can reach it with the lara console or hetzner staff can insert it for you; now here comes the problem; everything they do for you wether you need remote hands or some quick help or the console, it costs money, money money and watch out maybe on the first day you might burn a hole in wallet by doing so. They should make the lara console for free for the first time install. Same with payments,, they charge you buy the unit and also when you cancel your server or storagebox vps/hosting check your cancel date because it is set standard a month later. So yes they offer cheap stuff but it is not worthy of your time, money and stress! Useless company!

Even with serious hardware problems at the weekend you can always rely on their expertise that in 10 years that are their customer has always been excellent. 3. DDOS Protection Unlike many other providers that in the face of a volumetric attack disconnect you from the server creating damage, Hetzner automatically (within a few tens of seconds) activates a filter to the input packets in collaboration with Arbor Networks, filtering tens of gigabytes per second and leaving your servers reachable. Coupled with CloudFlare to protect against level 7 attacks (GET / POST http flood) is the perfect solution to have a site always reachable. 4. Network stability A very large network with hundreds of exchange and transport points makes it excellent both for dealing with DDOS attacks and to ensure speed and reachability of networks with a routing always perfect. I find it very strange to read negative comments about them. I think you need to have adequate system administration skills to manage their products and I can not express myself on managed services they offer as I have never used them, but if you are a sysadmin this is the best provider without a doubt.

F.V.,BE,"Updated Jun 13, 2021",1,Avoid Hetzner at all cost,"I've had a very poor experience with Hetzner. The management interface is very confusing when compared to other services such as OVH. They also practice very bad billing policies, be extra careful when you want to stop using their services because you will be billed more than what you expect, and the support is just rude. Seriously, I would advise to just go with OVH as they are more professional, have better DDoS protection, and a better management interface that doesn't seem to come directly from the nineties.

I then asked which one of my allocated IPv4 addresses the report had been in regards to as I could just suspend that server and we would be 100% kosher, but they stated they would not provide such information at all.

New heatsinks, new fans. They couldn't fix the issue. Hetzner have a minimum cancellation notice so they forced me to renew the server, but I did not pay the invoice out of principal. I mean how can they charge me for a server that didn't work in the first place? That's illegal in my EU country. So a year later I tried to order a new server. They refused the service to me because I had an unpaid invoice. I offered to pay the invoice and clear by debt. So they gave me their bank details, but since i'm used to their arrogant support I asked, ""Will you accept orders from me in the future once I pay for this invoice?"". They replied no.

I have experienced downtime once with Hetzner outside of a maintenance time, they responded to my ticket immediately, kept me updated and fixed the three down servers within 1/2 hours.

Rowan,GB,"Updated Aug 21, 2018",1,Dreadful billing policies and billing support,"The Cloud server itself was solid, no problems there whatsoever! The billing procedures and policies however are absolutely dire as is the helpfulness of billing support. On signup I either missed the Paypal subscription option or it does not exist. As a result I built up a number of unpaid invoices. Completely my fault. The grand total of all overdue invoices however was under 20 euro. Instead of just suspending the account to prompt payment, Hetzner send an email threatening a collection agency, stating that the account will not be reactivated even on receipt of payment. Well fine, I login to the billing system, pay all the overdue invoices via paypal and simply say to myself, well no great loss, there was nothing on the cloud server I needed. However next month I receive another part-month invoice for the few days of the month before they decided to delete the server and send their threatening email. Fair enough, However I now can't login to their billing system to pay via paypal. The new invoice has a payment link for paypal and at this point is not overdue, having only just been raised. No problem, I stupidly think, it's only for a couple of Euro, they'll re-enable the billing account to allow me to clear it as they did for the other invoices. 08/02/2018 - useless email reply from support stating they will not accept payment by paypal, ignoring the account history, where every other overdue invoice was paid by paypal. 08/06/2018 - useless email reply stating they cannot re-enable the billing account because there is an overdue invoice. 08/07/2018 - useless reply stating the account can only be activated after the invoice has been paid 08/08/2018 - Useful reply! they have unlocked the billing account and ask me to please let them know once I have made payment. However, FML, I don't check my email for the rest of that week. At the weekend, when I have time, I see it and I go to login to the billing account. Suspended again! The final straw was the below reply on 08/13/2018, in response to my email that the billing account was suspend still ""Dear Client We blocked your account again because you did not initiate the payment. Kind regards"" Fair enough you might think, but they send this without unsuspending the billing account or giving any instruction whatsoever. So I'm basically getting trolled now over a two euro invoice. Utterly despicable customer support. Edit 08/17 I've now managed to pay the invoice. My last two replies from customer support were as follows 08/14/2018 - unlocked the billing account, but only for three hours. This was useless to me, as I don't check my personal email that often. 08/15/2018 - A reply to state they would unlock the billing account for an hour as I had requested as I would be at my PC ready to pay. But also stated completely unnecessarily ""this is the last time I will unlock your account"". Katie, thanks for your response. That's fair enough. However given I was getting in touch with support to pay the sole just generated invoice for under two Euro (none were outstanding at this point) I experienced an undue amount of hassle and attitude given I was only trying to access the billing account. One note: maybe ""abuser"" is an unfortunate term to use here. having worked in the web hosting industry myself I assume you meant ""abuser"" in the sense of one who abuses their access to hosting / billing account, but on first reading I think most English speakers would take that to mean a violent or sexual abuser, which I'm sure is not what you meant! 21/08 Katie, again many thanks for your reply. However where you state: ""To the best of my knowledge we do not have a separate means of re-accessing customer's accounts just for invoicing or billing purposes. By gaining access to your account again, you also have access to any remaining servers on it."" This does seem incorrect in my case. I am currently able to login to your ""robot / accounts"" used for billing and view my invoices, but cannot login to the cloud console. This states the error "" Access restricted Your access to the Cloud Console is being denied. Please contact our support through the following contact form:"" This is absolutely fine with me and matches the last invoice I was sent, from which it appears the server was deleted due to the lower number of hours billed. At this point, I would obviously be most displeased to receive another invoice on the 1st September. But I guess we'll see! Thanks for your continued interest in the case."

I asked whether they thought it was in my interest to get a cloud solution, and they answered that they didn't know what would be in my interest, as they didn't know my demands. And that was that, I got the cloud solution an hour later... In ALL matters I prefer direct terseness when it comes to support. Give me an engineer at all times, rather than a sales-rep. :-) Hetzner just provides what developers need I think...

Ben Gough (Terrum),GB,"Updated Nov 26, 2020",4,"Great high-end machines in big datacenters, a lot of improvement in the last few years as well!","NEW REVIEW: I have been with Hetzner for coming up to 8 years now. I am ordering/renewing about 50 machines a year, and each one has been acceptable to its specifications. Support has also greatly improved in the last few years, albeit unmanaged yet they do still try their best to offer a solution (from my experience anyway), great methods for installing your own custom OS (such as a USB stick) and their best feature being free KVM which other competitors do not have. I've changed it from a 3 star to a 4 star - well done Hetzner for improving your service throughout the last few years! :) OLD REVIEW: I have been with Hetzner for about 5 years now, and I feel it's time I made a review on their auction machines. My first year with Hetzner I started by testing a few of the machines to find the perfect one for my requirements without technical flaws, I can completely understand how they would be wary of this, but due to the way their support had treated the situation and could not offer the necessary solution, I left them without my custom. It was about a day later I was quite surprisingly e-mailed by one of their representatives stating that they would like to help me with getting my machine setup the way I wanted. The main issues I had with the previous machines were that I could not install Windows on them, or that the installations would be very buggy, and there were issues I can't remember as it was so long ago - but overall, I have a working machine now which I've had for nearly a year and has been running flawlessly. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is simply because of their poor support - all of the workers there have very bad English, a very poor professional attitude and badly formatted e-mails, whilst I understand it is a German company, they should not advertise their products in a language they are not fluent or properly trained in. To add, I've been buying more machines from them the past couple of years and they have gone very well. It is just unfortunate that each machine I order must now go under human verification and I cannot cancel any machine that I order otherwise they will not accept any further orders from me. So whilst they have good machines, their support and trust in a long-term customer needs improvement upon. EDIT: In response to Kate's reply to this review, whilst I can understand everything they have said in the matter, if they calm to 'lose trust in these customers' then with that logic they have lost their trust for me regardless of the fact that I can't even cancel a server when I order it for over 3 years now. I like to think I have had a long/healthy enough relationship with Hetzner to have the limitation lifted."
