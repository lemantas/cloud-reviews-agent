paolo,IT,2 days ago,1,Account rejected without reason,"I tried to open an account with DigitalOcean and, after providing all the requested information, my application was rejected with no concrete explanation. Their response only mentioned some vague “security parameters” they cannot share — basically shutting me out without any transparency. It is absurd that a company that claims to be developer-friendly treats potential paying customers this way. I could have been a serious, loyal, and even promoting customer for their platform, but apparently they prefer to reject people without justification. On top of that, it’s not even straightforward to request the permanent deletion of personal data — which is unacceptable when it comes to privacy and compliance. If this is how DigitalOcean welcomes new users, I can only strongly advise others to stay away. There are far better and more respectful alternatives out there."
YaN CrowLeY,BR,2 days ago,1,Hosting Illegal & Abusive Content – Ignoring Victim Reports,"I am a victim of a serious violation of my privacy and personal rights, and DigitalOcean is currently hosting a website that is publishing explicit photos of me without my consent. The website exposes my full name, intimate images, and personal phone number, falsely associating me with prostitution. I never authorized the publication or use of any of this content. I contacted Cloudflare first, and they confirmed that DigitalOcean is the hosting provider behind this malicious site. I then attempted to notify DigitalOcean through their abuse contact form, but received no meaningful action or response. This situation is causing me extreme emotional distress and psychological harm. DigitalOcean is enabling the distribution of non-consensual pornography and personal data, which violates international laws including: Brazil’s LGPD (General Data Protection Law) Marco Civil da Internet (Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet) Brazilian Penal Code Art. 218-C (Non-consensual intimate content) International privacy and copyright laws I have already contacted lawyers and law enforcement. If DigitalOcean continues to allow this abuse through their infrastructure, I will take legal action directly against them for complicity. 🚨 I strongly advise others to avoid doing business with a company that ignores victims of abuse and hosts illegal content without accountability."

After cancelling my account, they continued to charge me. So, I reached out to them and was assured I would not be charged further. Fine, I was happy. That is, right up until I was charged again. Bear in mind, I can't even login because I deleted all of my information after they said it was taken care of. I have filed several (have lost count) appeals to support and the solution is always the same. ""Destroy your bucket."" Folks, I don't have a bucket to destroy and I can't login to ANYTHING. Please, just cancel me out completely! The latter, above, was sent today. I was met with ""send a screenshot of what you are seeing."" I have grown tired of sending them screenshots when all I am asking is to STOP CHARGING ME....PLEASE!!!! I have decided to warn others, here, about how difficult DigitalOcean is making a simple request. God help anyone who needs serious assistance."

Derick,US,"Aug 26, 2025",5,Above and Beyond the Call,"On one of the team we have in DigitalOcean, payment was NOT made and the notification emails never received. This was a complete goof up and DigitalOcean did what any respectable host would do and they shutdown/removed the managed database and the virtual machines. Once we had figured out what was going on, we reached out to support to see if there was anything they could to recover the lost database and web-server. They had absolutely no reason to tell us anything other than ""Sorry, they've been deleted"". Instead, they worked diligently and were able to recover the database for us which was a huge win. I am grateful to the DigitalOcean team for assisting us and they have certainly made a small fishing charter company in Florida very happy."

My account was suspended for a $142 balance that accumulated without my awareness. However, their support team (specifically Murtaza) was very understanding and professional. They listened to my situation, waived the charges as a one-time courtesy, and helped me close the account smoothly. While I wish the trial credit usage had been more transparent, I can't fault their customer service - they resolved my issue quickly and fairly. The support was responsive and empathetic. For new users: carefully monitor your resource usage during trials to avoid similar situations. But if issues arise, their support team is helpful."

Recently, we had an issue with an accidental overpayment, and I was fully prepared for the usual support nightmare. Instead, DigitalOcean resolved it in just 12 hours, with a clear, concise, and helpful response — no automated wall, no endless ticket loop, just human-level clarity and fairness. That level of support really inspires confidence. It’s rare to find a platform that combines solid infrastructure and a support team that actually gets things done quickly. Highly recommended — especially if you're looking for reliable hosting with real people behind it."

Giles Rafol,US,"Jul 13, 2025",5,Great Service for my Small Projects!,"I've been using Digital Ocean for at least 2yrs to host a small voice server my group of friends. Spinning up a Droplet is quick and easy. It takes just a few clicks to get things up and running. As such, I've also spun up Droplets here and here and there for testing and educational purposes. Then when I'm done with one, it's just as easy to delete. And same with maintaining them. The service is very stable; I don't think I've dealt with any outages any Digital Ocean so far. They make it easy to set up backups and perform snapshots and rollback when desired. Importantly the service is very inexpensive for our needs. For a pretty basic Droplet with weekly backups, I'm paying like $7-8/mo. One of the things I like is that I'm essentially paying by the hour. So if I spin up another Droplet to test something that only takes me an hour to do, I can delete it afterwards, and I'm only billed for that hour (which only costs a few cents). I'm not committed to a monthly fee. It's strictly pay as you go. Lastly, their support is excellent. I was doing some maintenance on the server recently, which caused a relatively minor issue with some of the metrics collection that Digital Ocean provides. Their support team was super quick to respond over the weekend. All my interactions with their team members were polite, friendly, and helpful! They really want their customers to succeed in their projects and I think that's commendable. For small projects and needs like mine, I highly recommend Digital Ocean!"

The initial sign-up process was smooth. However, my account was immediately flagged for ""Additional Info Required."" I understand the need for security, so I promptly created a support ticket and provided a detailed, honest explanation of my educational project goals and the specific technical resources I planned to use, as requested. The most disappointing part of my experience was the response. After waiting, I received a generic email stating that my account activation was rejected, with no specific reason provided. For a student genuinely trying to learn and use the platform for a legitimate portfolio project, this rejection felt like hitting a wall. While I understand the need to prevent abuse, the lack of transparency or guidance for legitimate new users is a major barrier. It would be much more helpful to provide feedback on what was wrong or how to meet the platform's criteria, rather than a final rejection that discourages new developers from considering DigitalOcean in the future. The process felt impersonal and did not seem to consider the context of a student user."

Palitha Lahiru,DE,"Jun 23, 2025",1,Extremely Disappointed – Poor Communication and Unfair Charges,"I used a VPS from DigitalOcean for a few months. Recently, they sent a copyright-related notice to my email — unfortunately, it went to my spam folder, so I missed it. Without any further warning or follow-up, they blocked the public IP address of my server. This caused a major outage for one of my clients, and I only found out when their system stopped working completely. I immediately contacted DigitalOcean support to resolve the issue, but after waiting more than 16 hours, I still didn’t receive a response. With no communication from their end, I had to pause all my work and migrate the entire platform to AWS at my own cost. I also had to compensate my client for the downtime. To make things worse, even though the server was inaccessible, DigitalOcean continued charging me for it daily. After 4 days with no response from support, I deleted the host entirely. Their handling of the situation was unprofessional, slow, and costly. I cannot recommend DigitalOcean after this experience. If your work is time-sensitive or client-critical, look elsewhere. Fast, reliable support and transparent communication are essential — and sadly, DigitalOcean fell short on both."

They *permanently and irrevocably deleted* all of my virtual machines after a few weeks of failing to contact me. You would think they would spend the extra few pennies to allow a customer to keep paying them. Nope, they do not care about you or your business. Do not make the mistake of hosting business-critical services with Digital Ocean. AVOID. Case in point -- See DigitalOcean's response. Note they do not offer a way to provide that case number to their support staff. It does not matter, I tried at least 4 times to resolve the issue with their support staff.

Alexei Danilchik,BY,"Updated Apr 29, 2025",4,"They’re really good, but be prepared for their changes to catch you off guard","I’ve been with DigitalOcean for about 10 years. During that time, I’ve had almost zero issues with them. Their documentation is extensive, everything is well-structured and user-friendly, and the service has been rock-solid. I’ve never had to contact support because my own knowledge was enough to handle any problems. Over the years, I’ve referred many clients to them, including some with substantial budgets. However, the recent changes - when they abruptly start blocking SMTP port 587 for new and upsizing droplets without warning left me deeply frustrated. I had to scramble to rebuild transactional email systems for clients. Relying on third-party email services isn’t always a viable solution. This is unacceptable behavior, such changes cannot be implemented ""overnight"", without prior notice. On the other hand, they're willing to remove restrictions upon request to customer support, but this takes a lot of time unless you have a paid support subscription."

It’s rare to get that type of support on platforms offering high-end cloud services unless you pay for support plans or if you are a high paying customer. Along with top-notch reliable services, they are focusing on GenAI to enable you innovate using their recent releases like (GPU Droplets, GenAI platform) where new models & features are added frequently. Based on experience tip: Because I’m constantly following their releases they offered me $50 Credits to try their new platform. So keep up with releases & you will find them supporting you 😉"

When we attempted to resolve the issue, we were informed that the account had been flagged by their automated security system —apparently due to our lack of our social media presence. We were unaware that DigitalOcean’s terms and conditions permit account termination without notice and disclaim responsibility for any resulting data loss or destruction. We were also unaware that social media presence was a condition of establishing and maintaining the service. Unfortunately, due to this clause, we are now in the process of moving our services to another provider. However, we felt it was important to share our deeply disappointing experience. Customer service was minimal and unhelpful responses were infrequent, poorly written, and clearly handled by offshore agents.

I am paying $8 for a 1gb ram 1cpu droplet, attempting to run a Wordpress Openlitespeed installation, and the site runs miserably. Repeated, daily ""Error establishing a database connection"". Understandably, the answer lies in upgrading to a server with more resources, but why should I pay $20+ when I can pay half the price elsewhere? To put into perspective, Digitalocean cost me $8 for 1CPU 1GB RAM OVH cost me $5 for 2CPU 2GB RAM On a legacy range I have a VPS with 16GB RAM costing just £20, the same with Digitalocean would cost me a heck lot more! At the end of the day I need a vps solution that balances my expense and turnover properly and digitalocean unfortunately doesnt allow for that. By paying less and getting more elsewhere the site runs fine. Instead I use digitalocean's budget range of products labelled general purpose, for my less intensive tasks like FTP and front end applications"

One of my droplets, hosting an old static website that was still serving its purpose but admittedly hadn't received much attention, was unfortunately compromised by malicious actors. These unauthorized users exploited the situation and consumed an excessive amount of bandwidth, resulting in an unexpected bill of several thousand dollars. When I reached out to the support team to explain the situation, I was immediately impressed by their response. They listened attentively to my circumstances and showed genuine understanding of the oversight that led to this security breach. What stood out most was their willingness to work with me on a solution - they generously provided a substantial refund of the charges. This experience highlighted not only their commitment to customer satisfaction but also their reasonable and fair approach to resolving issues, even when the root cause was partially due to my own oversight. Their handling of the situation has only strengthened my trust in their service after a decade of being their customer."

I have always been satisfied with their service in technical terms as well as with pricing. Recently I had a tough problem where my gmail login failed due to an issue with Google. I can imagine it is hard to create a fair and bulletproof recovery process for situations like mine. It did take a few days, but the issue was resolved in the utmost proffesional way. I had been given straight to the point precise instructions and every step made absolute sense. My problem was resolved with unexpected ease and it saved me an enourmous amount of time had I lost that account. I am happy to finally be able to use DO services for the new business I have just started.

I'm not going to run up a bill for services I don't need. They could even have asked for a pre-payment or whatever if they felt new customers are a risk. They didn't. Complete waste of time.

A warning to anyone else: if you cancel your services with them, add-ons for those services are not cancelled. The technical services are great but completely let down by the complete lack of help and support. Update (following their understanding reply here): DO are now threatening to refer my 10¢ debt to a debt collection agency. @DigitalOcean: I didn't have a ticket number. My account manager emailed asking what I needed help with. That was the sum of his reply. It makes no difference now as I've moved to another provider."

Phone calls by the sales manager and tech manager were ignored. Their customer support is shocking. Always blames the structure of the site. We then get this adjusted and the speed and bugs are still present. Then somehow it's all fixed. Magically you say has nothing been done. Then a week later its back so rubbish. It's like you have a button in the back you press to make it work. You have cost me thousands in lost orders, downtime and simply hosting the site but providing a substandard service. I have asked for compensation this has been ignored. I hope you as a company crash and burn !!! Really do hate you.

We tried to register account, without even selecting any product, they tried to charge us with random numbers. They didn`t accept 3 credit cards, and with 4th one as mentioned above they tried to charge is with some random number. Can`t get any explanation from their support. Time to look for alternatives. Update: So I am in contact with account manager from DO. Now he is saying that DO is charging 5$ only to activate account. So without even buying anything customer has to pay .

But don't you ever try and rely on DigitalOcean if you are a large business, because your competition can just take down your server without any issues.

madze,US,"Jun 27, 2024",5,Digital Ocean generally nails it.,"Digital ocean has, in my opinion the best balance of services, ease of use, and pricing strategy of any PAAS that we've explored. Their documentation is also second to none, and in the rare case that an issue arises that isn't well documented, their support team is excellent and responsive. I think the only service that we've used that could potentially benefit from some improvement is App Platform. In general, this is a very nice alternative to other big players (netlify, vercel) - particularly the pricing model. That said, this is definitely the service that we have had the most issues come up, and confusion with configurations and the console UI. It's also relatively new and will likely continue to be improved so I'm inclined to refrain from forming any concrete judgement just yet."

胡jm,TW,"Jun 12, 2024",5,The best experience ever！！,"In today's rapidly evolving digital age, servers play a crucial role, serving as the cornerstone of network services and data management. A quality experience with servers is reflected not only in their performance and stability but also in the speed and effectiveness of customer service and technical support. In this article, I will share a memorable server experience, which is not just an appreciation for the hardware, but also a gratitude towards the service providers. ### Stability and High Performance of the Server In the project I was responsible for, we needed a server. We chose Digital Ocean, a well-known server provider. What was truly impressive is the server's high stability and reliability since deployment. It could continuously handle data requests, even during peak times, without significant drops in response speed. This provided a stable operating environment for our project, ensuring consistency and reliability in user experience. ### Immediate, Professional Customer Service Although the server's performance was satisfying, technical issues were inevitable during use. This was when the importance of the server provider's customer service and technical support became evident. When encountering a configuration issue, we contacted their customer service. Surprisingly, not only did they respond quickly, but they also provided very professional guidance. Their technical team carefully analyzed our situation, offered targeted solutions, and guided us through solving the problem step by step. This efficient and professional service experience was very satisfying and reassuring. ### Service That Exceeds Expectations Beyond solving problems, the server provider also proactively offered optimization suggestions, helping us improve server usage efficiency and performance. This proactive approach and attitude that exceeded customer expectations were impressive. It not only solved the immediate issue but also prevented potential future problems, making this forward-thinking service invaluable. ### Conclusion A quality server experience is both a trust in technology and a recognition of service quality. It's not only about hardware performance but more about the professionalism and care of the service team. A reliable server, coupled with professional and timely technical support, can significantly enhance work efficiency and ensure the smooth progress of projects. Such an experience deeply made me realize the value of technology service providers, laying a solid foundation for the success of our project."

They required “evidence” of the hacking, however, they failed to include any way of getting them the evidence. No attachment option and no email option that I could find on their site.

Anthony,GB,"Updated Jun 9, 2024",1,I am writing to express my…,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the billing practices of Paperspace. Recently, I was unexpectedly charged £15.72 for building the spec PC and by DigitalOcean today i find out i was owe money today for 30 seconds of service than giving me a warning is gives me a loan for $19.73, which I believe to be a scam. At no point was I informed about any potential additional costs or payment obligations in the initial agreement as we never read them and only look at the page i never warned about them having a hidden cost that hidden where i can't tell if is only for running cost and not for mouthy cost . Here are the key issues I encountered: provided with no info about hidden costs by Paperspace did not indicate that I would owe any money beyond the initial setup fees. This lack of clarity led to unforeseen charges that were not disclosed upfront. Billing Practices: I was charged $19.73 for a mere 30 seconds of usage, This charge was not clearly explained or justified in any communication or payments so i was owe money for nothing until i look at . Misleading Information: It appears that Paperspace may be using infrastructure that is not entirely theirs. This was shown by disclosed at any point, and I feel deceived as a customer. Additionally, I found that DigitalOcean claims I owe them money through Paperspace, which is troubling. There was no prior communication or any email indicating that I would be liable for additional costs from DigitalOcean. This lack of transparency has caused significant inconvenience and financial stress. In comparison, Shadow PC offers similar services without such hidden charges. They have never restricted my access to their systems, unlike Paperspace, which I suspect may be due to them recognising my advanced usage needs. Conclusion Paperspace's billing practices and lack of transparency have led to a highly unsatisfactory experience. I urge inspectors to review these practices to protect future customers from similar issues. Clear, upfront communication about all potential charges and liabilities is essential to maintain trust and integrity in such services. DigitalOcean - Has never tell to place a info where they need to says about the costs of building them ( Only shown hourly payments not mouthly when i review my payment they never says about owe money I hope they refund the money they Owe because when did anyone review the documentation ever now in 2024 we used everything from 1998 to build them not clear and even says about hidden costs on the site where you rent them ( I know them a scam now ) Saying this now Your account has been restricted and you cannot create new resources. Please submit a payment of $50.00 before Wednesday, Jun 12 to prevent account suspension. prevent account suspension - for nothing never said about this so it RIGGED TO FAIL everyone who willing to pay"

Moved to a competitor, much better!","UPDATE: They replied to this review asking for a ticket id saying they would review it again. 4 months on from that and still nothing! Clearly a empty promise to try and save face on bad reviews. I have been a personal customer of Digital Ocean for years and never had a problem. I recently wanted to create an account for my business. Went on to create the account, added the business's credit card, used the business's email, etc. The account was automatically suspended and said that I needed to supply additional details; this isn't too uncommon so didn't think much of it. The issue is that to ""maintain the integrity of our security systems"" the support can't tell you what information they want. It is so random. I told them what we planned to use it for, a sales tracking tool and supplied our GitHub. I also included a copy of my ID, lots of business documents (bank statements & insurance) and even invoices from their sister company Cloudways, were we have had an active account at (with the same email) for over two year. This was all rejected and given a generic, ""we cannot disclose which factors were identified"" for why we can't accept this. I am not sure what else they could want. We are a UK based company with a large amount spent at their sister company, I had given document to verify the business and myself. I understand the need for security but I sent enough info to get a bank account and pass any KYC/AML checks, as well as told them what we were going to use it for. What else do they want? If they are so boneheaded to have rules like this then how will they react if something goes wrong with their service? I closed our account with Cloudways and have moved everything to OVH where instead of getting suspended and getting absolutely zero help from support on how to unsuspend it, you get assigned an account manager who rings you to make sure you aren't having any problems onboarding. I know what I prefer. Ticket #08670478"

I sent a support ticket, they asked me for more information and logs, and then they could fix the problem on their end. I had no downtime while they applied the fix. Replies from them were each less than 4 hours after my initial ticket and replies, even though I don't have a paid support plan with guaranteed response times. The only minor detail I could complain about is that part of the extra information they asked me for was something I had already said in my initial ticket. However, I'm sure that's because support reps use reply templates to save time, and I must say despite those templates, the whole interaction still ""felt personal"", and not like I was getting canned responses all the time."

I submitted a request to change the email associated with my DigitalOcean account due to the old one was no longer supported by Google.

Very basic straightforward use case of pulling data from one system and sending it to another. No emailing functionality, no scraping, no suspicious business whatsover. It's literally automating copy-pasting manual work. Barely a month in and out of the blue, I receive an account suspension email. The droplet was inaccessible and the app was down. Surely an error! Back and forth of them asking for detailed personal information without providing any specific reason beyond ""platform abuse involving your account and/or DigitalOcean resources"". No amount of information and offers to rectify any mishap made a difference... No access to the droplet so I cannot investigate and they don't say what they spotted or what went wrong. Once it became clear that the suspension wasn't going away, I asked for the data on the droplet.. Low and behold: ""Unfortunately, we can not proceed further with your request to unlock the account temporarily to retrieve the data."" In conclusion: run and don't look back. They will remove your access, not give any reason and withhold your data!"

A guy from Austria,AT,"Updated Feb 8, 2024",1,Terrible experience,"Let me tell you about my experience, it's bad on multiple levels. 1. I registered for DigitalOcean and my account was locked immediately for no reason. So I opened a support ticket. 2. This ticket was opened in August 2023, at the time of this review it's February 2024. I contacted the support again a few days ago, and they answered within an hour. My account was unlocked again. 3. So finally, I could use DigitalOcean. Could I? No, because their interface doesn't accept my tax number. My tax number starts with letters, but their input field does not accept letters at all. So I tried putting in my personal tax number, which does not, but it also didn't work. It also didn't accept my tax number without the letters. 4. So I contacted their support again with the hope that I would get a similarly fast response, but I'm still waiting. 5. Just to complete the list: They list me services for which I need to apply. Basically, I cannot create those resources unless I contact their support and they unlock those for me. 6. Update: After having written this review. The support kept telling me how to fill out the tax field, and I kept repeating that I couldn't. Eventually, I explained to them that I either kept doing something wrong or their system did not work, and if they kept telling me how to do it, it was likely that I would not find my mistake. Now they said that they will ""come back"" to me. It sums up how many things do not work at DigitalOcean. Summarized, in the meantime, I created an AWS account. The integration was super easy, and they did not ask any stupid questions. Since I started building a part of my application on AWS, I do not think that I will consider DigitalOcean again. Mixing cloud providers is not a good idea. If someone from DigitalOcean is reading this: You could have had me as your customer, but you did not want me."

Nik M,PT,"Updated Feb 6, 2024",1,Frustrating Experience with Server Issues and Support at DigitalOcean,"I recently had a challenging experience with DigitalOcean, particularly with server-related issues that were not due to any fault on my end. The primary problem was with my CRON jobs, which unexpectedly stopped executing. This issue required me to monitor and identify the problem myself before reaching out to their support team for assistance. Upon contacting DigitalOcean for help, I was disappointed with their response. Instead of offering a direct solution or acknowledging the inconvenience caused, they provided me with a set of steps to upgrade the server. As someone who relies on their service, I found it frustrating to be tasked with technical troubleshooting, which I believe should have been managed on their end. Moreover, I had requested a refund for the period when the droplet was non-functional due to these server issues. Unfortunately, my request was overlooked, adding to my dissatisfaction. The support team, although courteous, did not address this concern adequately. In the end, I made the decision to cancel my droplet and move to a different provider. While I understand that technical issues can happen, I believe the way they are handled makes a significant difference in customer experience. Unfortunately, in my case, DigitalOcean's approach and support did not meet my expectations. Ticket ref: ref:!00Df2018t5m.!5004P02KM5pD:ref"

Dave,AM,"Dec 8, 2023",3,"Bad service, good product","The product is good, but everything else is concerning. You can get your account completely locked in the middle of setting up projects for clients after having used DigitalOcean for months. Support can ignore your ticket for two weeks, and when you attempt to create a new ticket for the same issue it will automatically be closed. I was only able to get support to take a look at my ticket by creating a ticket in a completely unrelated section with the text completely reworded. They will refuse to explain why your account got locked and will offer zero reassurance that it won't happen again and no advice for how it can be avoided. Great for hobby projects or if you don't mind potential downtime or loss of data. If you're a professional, I would avoid it."

Mostly I am happy - simple products at good prices. Two areas which annoy me are: - Container Registry free level is tiny. What is worse is that, if limit is breached, push fails and allowance is filled with garbage that only Digital Ocean support can remove. Just terrible value compared to AWS et al. - Managed Database Service minimum price is $15 per month for 10GB, when most of my applications need only 100MB. This is driving me to other cloud service providers."

Robert Stone,US,"Nov 19, 2023",5,"Good service even for the ""little guy""","I'm one of those guys who usually just has one VPS running, but running all the time. Well mine was running for 7 years, even when I wasn't paying much attention to it. Never had any problems, never had it get deleted or had to reinstall it due to an upgrade or anything. And the one time I did have a support request, they got back to me in 1-2 days with real answers that took some effort even though I wasn't paying any extra for a support contract. So while you can get a VPS from a cut-rate provider with theoretically twice the resources for the same price, you're going to have to pre-pay for 1+ months and won't be able to resize the VPS without going through a shopping cart and pre-paying again where as DO will let you scale up and down at will and just bill by the minute. So overall, DO is reliable, less complicated than the mega-services, and still has reasonable treatment of the little guy. There's not much to complain about."

Hex Tech,NA,"Oct 14, 2023",5,10/10 Would Use Again and Again,"Honestly I have yet to try other service providers besides DigitalOcean, since I clearly hit the perfect mark from the start. Have been with them since 2017, hosting a variety of web apps. Overall they are amazing due to: - Really Affordable Pricing - Great Help Documentation - Superb customer support, open a ticket and within a day usually I was helped and they are always friendly - Never had a single hour of down time - Their services are easily scalable - They have great variety of services from storage mounts to Object Storage Spaces - The dashboard is super easy to use All in all, there hasn't been a single red flag for me and will most likely continue to use them as long as I can."
Julian,GB,"Oct 12, 2023",2,The best host with the worst support.,The best host with the worst support. You could do so much better. Dealing with Digital Ocean's support team is like trying to balance a house of cards in a hurricaine... with a blindfold on and both arms tied behind your back. I explained a very simple situation to them and they came back offering their profound wisdom on a completely different situation. I then clarified my situation and they come back saying they can't help because they don't have access to user accounts. What is the point of having a support team that cannot offer any support? I actually got a solution from ChatGPT.... from a robot... they are wasting money on their support staff.
Thad Guidry,US,"Oct 11, 2023",5,Suprising Decent Customer Support!,Really decent customer support if you pay $99 a month and well worth it when needed to resolve issues. Especially when you get yourself into a corner because you didn't read closely their excellent docs!

Tom,GB,"Oct 8, 2023",1,Service Terminated At Random With Zero Explanation,"Pretty appalled by the treatment I have received from this provider. I created an account with DigitalOcean in May of 2014. I used the account to spin up a single droplet at that time and kept it running for around a year. I believe at the time I was using it to host a Wordpress blog which I was developing a theme for. The day before yesterday (nearly 8 years since the droplet was active) I attempted to login to the account and was met with a notice that my account was locked/disabled and that I needed to contact support. I couldn't remember my history with this provider at the time I signed in as a long time had past and I have hosting with close to 8 different hosting providers, some I've been using for 20 years! So I opened a ticket and asked what was going on, I couldn't remember when I last used this account but would like it unlocked so I could check my account history and change my password as it'd been unchanged for many years. The response I got was pretty shocking: ""Upon reviewing your account, it appears that your deployment and actions were in violation of our Terms of Service Agreement [1] and Acceptable Use Policy [2] and as a result, your account has been locked and offboarded from our platform."" They proceeded to inform me that they can't tell me what it is that I have done and not to attempt to sign up again with a new account as I am banned permanently from their service. This response forced me to go and dig through email backups to see when I signed up, when I last used it and if I had any correspondence from them at all regarding this. I had absolutely no messages from them regarding ""violating"" anything nor any messages about the service being suspended. I have never been treated this way by a hosting provider before - I absolutely never violated their Terms of Service nor have I violated any providers T&S. They have clearly made a huge mistake. It's worrying I think for other users - I didn't have an active service with them so no loss but If they can callously terminate your account for nothing without any warning, I dread to think how this could impact users who have active droplets or busy websites. Disgusting."

Needless to say I really appreciate Jonathan Swayne's insight into the issue I was having.

I've spent nearly 2-3 weeks going back and forth with their team trying to get access to the account to no avail. There circular logic for access is painful and as a result their final communication is there is nothing we can do. No additional response, no apology, no guidance on setting up a new one and transferring the files. So all in a service that works unless you need an actual human to do any thinking!!

I was a customer there for at least 10 years. However, one day they locked my account. When I asked support why and to please unlock it they said that I had violated their Terms of Service and Acceptable Usage policies. Then they said ""please note that we’re unable to share details regarding what factors we considered that led to this decision."" They concluded their e-mail with ""We recommend you find a new service provider that better suits your needs."" If you're wondering whether or not I did illegal and terrible things that might violate these agreements, the answer is ""no."" I ran my business servers on their servers for about 10 years. In short, their service is great. However, just do yourself a favor and make REGULAR backups OFF of DigitalOcean. One day they may just shut you down for a reason they can't disclose.

The company seems to have an issue that a UK business can have a foreign living director. Everything was completed, but a canned response was sent and asked for social media details. Which weren't needed. Not an instant setup, it took around 24 hours to get launched, after responding to their email explaining that my UK business is registered with a banking payment card from a Spanish address and correctly reflected in HMRC, companies house etc.. What I did not wish to undertake was social media verification and as said, a canned response it wasn't needed. But now the account has been activated, the services look good value.

David Svarrer,KE,"Jun 4, 2023",1,Digital Ocean - an ocean of no Digital Response,"Well, I have for the longest time tried to sign up with this company. The only thing I have really got return from them, is spam, spam and more spam. They are advertising alllll their fantastic supports and services, but, when one wants to sign up - you get none of it. Well. They ask you to deposit USD 5 to signup, and while it is a bit peculiar, I thought - OK - it will for sure filter out all those who are not serious. But. The ones who should be paying USD 5, is actually Digital Ocean. I had several questions to them, and have in various ways written to them to ask, but, no response. After giving them a piece of my mind, suddenly they responded, but, sent it all back to me, as if they had not read what my request was about - and I am still at square 1 with them. The point I cannot get them to explain is, what it would cost to run with them. Their response is to try them out. Well. As a professional cloud provider should they not have more than 10 years of experience to figure out how in measurable terms to tell a prospect client what to expect? The point of the matter is, that if a corporation cannot even have human beings to respond to queries from a beginner user - then how would we ever grow with them? The date below is the most recent experience with them. I have had more than 20 encounters with them, as they have kept advertising how good they are. Sorry to say so, but, it has been one big disappointment. Sigh."

They had me thinking both were completely deleted. Beginning of March, they proceed to take money from my PayPal/Bank account. I have proceeded to multiple times to gain a refund, and they flat out refuse and keep telling me I'm ineligible for one, which we all know is an absolute lie. To put things in to perspective. This alleged invoice was dated for January 2023. My free credit ran out at the end of February 2023. They waited until the Beginning of March, after my free credit ran out, to bill me for something which wasn't even due in the first place as I had deleted my services with them. I have been back and forth with them all week and getting nowhere. They have had plenty of chances to admit their wrong doings and rectify this.

No email explanation or nothing, after reaching out via support I've got a response within 1 minute saying that Hello, Thank you for registering for a DigitalOcean account. Our automated security tooling identified patterns that suggest your account is not eligible for activation, which resulted in an account lock. After review by our support staff, we have determined that restoring access to your account will not be possible. which is absurd, I suggest trying other services as doing business like this is unacceptable"
Luke S,HK,"Feb 21, 2023",1,"Arbitrarily deleted all my data, no recourse","Locked my account for breaching the terms of service. Wasn't doing anything remotely questionable. Fair enough though, reached out to ask why and to get it unlocked. They wouldn't tell me why, told me they had already conducted a 'final review' and that I wouldn't even be able to migrate my data off their platform! Google them to see many other similar stories (I wish I had before using them). Not suitable for any production service, but ok otherwise as long as you are making very frequent backups."

I bought a server from DO to carry my employers sites across - utilising the ability to increase droplet resources when required. 1st domain I moved across I ended up moving it back to Shopify. The domain wouldn't resolved properly - it was using DOs DNS. Every email I got back from support led to support articles and never an actual resolve. I missed the deadline twice hence ended up moving it to Shopify. 2nd domain I haven't moved yet, but seeing it's run by amateurs and DO themselves say it's not foolproof - they seem to be OK enough to take you money. I think it's good if you want a quick/cheap server for testing out various technologies - but for commercial use, a definite NO. And, DO, a support ticket to yourselves isn't going to resolve the matter because by the looks of it your responses here are also generic/replicated."

Do not use Digital Ocean if your infrastructure is mission critical as their internal support and customer support is actually worse than reseller hosting from some dodgy reseller. Edit: just been updated, DO have deemed a Laravel webservice with very low resource overheads a threat to platform security. Please avoid DO at all cost, as they are apparently according to their customer service unable to provide services.

Anonymous,DE,"Updated Jan 10, 2022",2,Here is my review,"I'm a professional system engineer since more than 20 years. I builded Cloud services myself, developt big API services myself and even worked with IBM Mainframes running AIX etc. 1. DO is totally overpriced since the first day. Sorry guy's but the performance is just bad for the price especially CPUs are totally overbooked. You aren't AWS so please don't try to act like a competitor, you're not. 2. In 2022 Cloud automation is nothing new nor special. Actually most features DO offer's I can do myself using Saltstack/Ansible. The funny thing to me is that DO still think's that they can charge people simply because they offer idiot like automation processes ... Don't get cheated here. 3. If I pay 40$ for a very basic VPS I expected more than 200 Mbps throughput, I also expect failover mechanism if a hypervisor fails (and DO does not, they have local SSD's), as to me this is also part of Cloud automation, it's not just a business model guy's. But yes sure it's expensive as everything has to be stored on shared network SAN system but this does not seem to match the vision of DO, at that price ... (Total fail to me... Did you guy's ever heard about Ceph? Just maybe) 4. The UI of DO is in many instances badly written JS code, not just that my developer console within Firefox goes mad with error messeages, no there are also loading issues no matter what browser I use. Sometimes it's working fine, sometimes not ... 5. Because of the pricing I would never choose DO for development or production, besides the missing support. I really can get the same reasources for a 5th of the price with the same features, why choose DO? Because of there animated shark mascot, Well I don't think so. Where is the argument for me as a customer? To me there is a lot of potential according to DO. On the other side DO is already running since years so I really don't think there will be much changes in the future, simply because DO is very process orientated company they've got stuck at a specific point ...

They deleted all the data that we were working for the last 2 years and just say sorry we cannot do anything. The payment didnt go through and havent received any notification about it. They said they waited for 3 weeks and deleted all the data and they cannot restore or give the backup data. Most importantly, they do not have a call support which is super annoying to read and write long emails in the middle of the chaos they created. And they expect us to be polite and professional. Knowing how worst their support system is, I would not recommend Digital ocean to anyone. Though they mention they provide world class service at an affordable price, It definitely comes with a cost."

READ THIS SUPPORT REQUEST--,"(MY ACCOUNT IS LOCKED OUT THE INSTANT I ENTER MY CREDIT CARD INFO, THEN I RECEIVE THIS EMAIL) ""Hello, Thank you for registering for a DigitalOcean account.

Please provide us with additional information about how you plan to use our platform including potential resource requirements.

Moritz Sattler,ES,"Dec 17, 2021",1,Do not host production systems on DO,"I host my app on managed Kubernetes on digital ocean. One day I realise I have a bug. No problem I think, lets just login to DO and I will take care of it. Upon login, it tells me they send me an email with 6 digits I need to enter. I check my Gmail - nothing. I make double sure that it's not in spam or anywhere where I could have missed it. I even checked if I receive emails correctly. But it seems like DO's email system is buggy. Since my production system is down, and this is quite urgent, I write DO support. And I, a paying customer, get no reaction. I wrote them a couple more messages and opened a few more tickets, but they're not reacting. My production system has been down for more than 24h now, and DO is absolutely unreachable. I posted to their community forum, just to be told that the forum/moderators there will not be able to assist me. The bottom line is, if you have a critical system, host it elsewhere, as the DO is buggy, and may lock you out, and their customer support is almost non-existent."
Raymond Reggers,NL,"Updated Dec 11, 2021",1,"Worst experience with a company, EVER.","I wanted to try out kubernetes on DO for a machine learning project. I liked the clear cost indication and the 100$ trial seemed great. I actually wouldn't have mind to start without this ""gift"" because of the simple ux. However, this turned out to be my worst experience with a company, EVER. After 1 day of running a workload on 10 vm's, my account got locked. I responded to the support ticket, offering them to look at what i was planning to use the DO for. I got a reply stating that my account was permanently locked by their automated system and they couldn't change that. Meanwhile my 10 machines are still running (150 hours). And i can't stop them because my account is locked. Nor can i delete my account, or remove my credit card. Because I was worried they would keep these machines running. Now at the time of writing my machines are still running (1500) hours, and my credit card will be billed. In follow up mails they stated ""Services are now unavailable and billing attempts will not occur."" However just now I received a notice ""This is a notice that your usage costs this month have exceeded the credit balance on your account. Your card on file will be charged at the end of the month for any remaining balance."" So long story short, you sign up for a free trial. They lock your account, keep costs increasing, their support states you won't be billed. But at the end of the day you'll be charged. FYI I blocked DO from my credit card. And with this experience I hope any new customer won't ever consider using DO as a trustworthy partner. I'm now using GKE and google can happily charge my creditcard. Tip for DO: Stop with the 100$ credit, because the way you are handling serious new customers is a joke. I would't have mind paying right from the start, because I liked the clear UX and cost forecast. My feeling is that DO's vm's are cheaper because their vm's use a lot of shared resources. My use case of running ML workloads which 100% utilise cpu's are not desired for them. Avoid them at all costs."

Hey, guys, just maybe there's a problem with your sign-up process?? After interacting with the support process, which clearly doesn't involve humans at all, I finally got the account unlocked. Now they want me to pay them money again to verify my identity even though I've already done it once on that account. Forget it. I've registered and got a site up and running on Vercel in the time it took for one support exchange on DigitalOcean. One more customer lost."
Chris Harris,US,"Nov 12, 2021",1,Cheap and fast but unreliable,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for. The servers were affordable and fast to spin up, that was great. Their customer support doesn't have a phone line, and takes days to respond, so don't count on any assistance. Even when you do reach them, they are not helpful. I had been paying for backups and then those backups were not available. Instead of either working to provide my backups to me or provide me a refund for the payment to the backups, I was told they could provide me with neither. I won't be using digitalocean going forward and would not recommend them to other developers. I lost months of work and thousands in development cost due to them losing my backups."

A friendly UI/UX and their fantastic documentation. I truly search for digitalocean +problem whenever have a linux problem :-) Beyond that I think they have the best prices. It is so easy and fast to create a droplet that I dont care to do experiments and have everything go wrong. For me, they have overall a decent solution, with an easy UI/UX and a great documentation. Speed is also good. The only negative I found is that they do not have data center in Greece or Italy. Hope they manage to create something there too."
Kevin August,US,"Updated Nov 11, 2021",5,Highly recommended for devs / server administrators.,"As an SEO and server admin, I highly recommend this platform for the amazing up-time and ease of use when it comes to the control panel. Nothing overly complicated as long as you know your way around the command line as most experienced dev's do. Pricing is far better than hosts like WPEngine where your hosting is managed by their staff, but costs about double what you pay if you learn to administrate your own instances (droplets). Highly recommend this platform for experienced users. Very surprised to see so many negative reviews but most seem to have to do with security / fraud lockouts for international customers - which I do understand as DO does a great job keeping bad sites / nefarious actors off their platform."

The thing people need to realise is that DigitalOcean is a ""developers cloud provider"" - that is, you must have the knowledge to look after your droplets, keep them patched and updated using apt as if they were on premises. It is up to you to set up the (excellent) firewall and load balancers via the web interface or 'doctl' command line program. As a Dev, the performance and resilience of 'my' droplets and applications is down to me, and I love this level of freedom and control over my environment."

John Fricker,JP,"Updated Aug 30, 2021",1,Why do you have to enter your payment information just to see how much things might cost?,"I've been trying to evaluate which service can provide the cheapest Kubernetes cluster for me to use for a hobby project. AWS, GCP, and Azure all provide quite transparent pricing. That is to say: they have pricing calculators and you can look up the prices for CPU, memory, etc. In contrast, Digital Ocean is very opaque when it comes to pricing. Their advertising says you can get a Kubernetes cluster ""from $10"" but doesn't go into details. Their pricing calculator deals only with Droplets (not sure what these are - I'm assuming it's like Google Cloud Run), not clusters. Their pricing page doesn't provide any more insight either. So, I did the next logical thing: open an account and hope that I can see the prices once I'm registered. What I didn't expect was to be greeted with a request to verify my identity by providing my payment details. Why, when we live in a world where major companies have had data breaches and leaked PII, must I provide my payment information just to try and find out how much a service costs? I could understand if I was trying to use one of their services, but I wasn't. I was just trying to evaluate their pricing. I contacted them via Twitter (the ""contact sales"" page button just went to ""please wait"" but never did anything and I found out via the Chrome debugger that the page had errored because of broken code) and all they did was tell me to file a support ticket. I did so and I'm now waiting for a reply, but given my experience I don't think I'll be choosing DO even if they turn out to be the cheapest option. Edit: DO support have come back to say that it's not possible to sign up without adding a payment method, so given their lack of transparency on pricing I'm going to give them a miss."

TheGreatPatsy,PT,"Updated Sep 6, 2021",1,A heaven for spammers,"My ISPs spam filter works quite well, but there are between 1-3 spams that get through each day, and all originate from DigitalOcean's servers. The company has a reputation for not doing anything about this and seems to be happy to provide spammers with servers and changing IP addresses. As a potential client I will never support such a company. Update: I did file a ticket as requested and I sent them headers of some spam mails I have received from their servers. About a week later I received the email below which I interpret in the way that they have no interest in catching spammers using their servers. N.B.: the spammers are paying customers. I am happy to supply Digitalocean with some spam received (which I already did) but not my physical signature, all my personal information and statements under the penalty of perjury. All this is not needed to identify spammers that use their systems. I mean, really??? Their reaction just shows that this is a company to stay away from. Anyway, here is the last response from them after I have sent them the requested spam samples: Thank you for your report. We have reviewed the details and noticed that the required information for a complete, valid report is missing.

This is a different restriction from the one where some new customers can’t connect to port 25 at all - support advised me I wasn’t subject to this new customer restriction anyway but even if customers manage to get this new customer restriction lifted, they only unblock it on IPv4. The IPv6 restriction is at network level not account level and there’s no way to remove this block. It’s permanent and applies to all customers. It seems like a strange policy to me - I completely get you may want to do extra diligence on new customers to prevent abuse before letting them use SMTP, but you allowed connections over IPv4 without issue in my case but not IPv6 which seems like a significantly lesser risk? I’m not sure what risk you’re mitigating by allowing traffic over one protocol but not the other, especially as IPv6 isn’t as widely used. Unfortunately, when I raised this issue with support and presented evidence of the blocks, they insisted they don’t do any such blocks. It took 4 responses for them to finally admit they have this policy - all the while my server is racking up charges. The policy seems silly in my eyes anyway, but if you insist on having it, I expect your staff to be aware of it (but also be open minded enough to challenge their knowledge when presented with pretty firm evidence rather than ignoring it)."

I've been working in IT infrastructure for years and have never once been denied to purchase provided services, not a single time. All I have to say is do not waste your time. This has to be a scam and if my credit card ends up being charged again we will be speaking to our lawyers. Fwiw, they gave no indication as to why we are being denied except for this response: ""Hi there, Thank you for following up in regards to the lock on your account. Our automated security tooling identified patterns that suggest your account is not eligible for activation. To be sure, I just conducted a manual review of your account and have confirmed that we are unable to override this decision. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by this. Additionally, please note that we’re unable to share details regarding what led to this decision as this is critical to maintaining our security systems."""

Hernán,AR,"May 28, 2021",5,Happy customer for 5 years,"I have been a happy customer of Digital Ocean for the last 5 years and never had an issue with them. I moved in from a typical shared hosting because they used to have many restrictions, and, in the end, the entry price was similar. Being a VPS, the setup wasn't easy at that time, but I managed to create a solid server that never let me down, and I have done customizations that I would never have been able to do in a shared hosting. I find that Digital Ocean is somewhere between a typical hosting and AWS: not as hard to use as AWS, but with many tools that make management easier and a good price for the value."

Tom Tolkien,GB,"May 24, 2021",1,Digital Ocean refused to cancel my account and delete my personal information.

When I tried to cancel my account, cancel my billing and delete my personal information, yet more bugs on the Digital Ocean platform prevented me from being able to delete my account. I provided a video of the bugs on their platform via loom to Digital Ocean support, who ignored my support ticket and did not respond. I also got in touch with Digital Ocean on Twitter, who refused to help. This company appears to be a scam. It would appear that, in preventing and refusing to delete accounts, billing, and personal information when requested, Digital Ocean would appear to be trying to ensure that billing is continued even if the product is not being used and the customer has specifically requested termination of the account. If Digital Ocean refuses to cancel a customer account when requested, this amounts to fraud. Furthermore, in refusing to delete billing and personal information when requested, Digital Ocean is in breach of all US, UK and EU data protection laws. Avoid this company!"

After some 3-5 emails with them they say that they pass your request to the engineering team, who only once out of 8 times admitted the problem on their side. Usual response is - we looked at the charts and everything is fine on our side. I never managed to get my request passed to people, who actually check something beyond the performance charts assuming that they might have a bug in their system. So support is non-existent. If something doesn't work, don't expect it to be fixed. When you write to support, then be prepared to prove that you are not an idiot first with 3-5 emails."

TWELVE HOURS LATER, DO still not responded back to CW, so the only known fact was that it could not be reached via the network (very obvious). Ping was working though, so I left a 1 second ping writing to a log for 12 hours. There was not one interruption, meaning DO most likely did absolutely bugger all to the server during that whole period (no starting/stopping). After 14 hours still with no info from DO, I decided to bite the bullet and asked Cloudways to restore from backup (to a Vultr server - goodbye DO). Had to re-key a day of orders and product updates manually, but there was no indication whatsoever from DO if/when the server would be fixed whilst I'm continuing to lose hundreds in sales and reputational damage. My advice: don't use DO unless you're able to restore from your own DR backup quickly, because you are quite literally just a 'Droplet' in their Digital Ocean."

The logical thing would be that they will mention that ""Atypical Activity"" was presented because it only had websites and the mail service that I tried so hard to remove from the blacklist because practically all the DO's ASN is blacklisted. The worst of the case is that I have clients who are going to look for me at home to burn me alive and DigitalOcean has the luxury of responding every 6 hours with a super mega generic response that seems taken from a draft with just the typical name change (Yes, that's exactly what you see even here, the same answer but with a different name). Surely the menso comes to tell me by answering this comment to open a support ticket mentioning the incident. Know? I have almost 15 fuck1ng days waiting for a ticket to be answered and there it is still, waiting for them to answer it, or... that I ended up answering a bot with the most generic answer you will find on the internet.

After years of spending tens of thousands of dollars on their services we just woke up with our account blocked for no given reason and have no way of finding out what happened or why it was blocked. I assume it's because of the awful job they do keeping track of who's using their resources at each particular time as on more than one occasion it happened for us to receive complaints which should have gone to another one of their users' but unfortunately there's noone to talk to on their side about it. I would say their support department is terrible, but that would imply that they have one, don't expect to be able to ever talk to anything other than an auto-reply bot. To give you an example of what you can expect after years of doing business with them: ---Their message: Hi there, We've deemed the activities on the account are in violation of the DigitalOcean user agreement, and your account has been locked and disabled as a result. In ten days, your account will be terminated and your data will be permanently deleted. If you feel it is an error, please reply to this email. Regards, Security Operations Center DigitalOcean ---Our reply: Hello, We think you may have wrongfully blocked our account. We had this account for several years without any issues, we hadn't changed what we do with it in the meantime and we cannot find anything in the User's Agreement we would be in violation of. Additionally we received several times in the past messages from you informing us of incidents (e.g. phisihing, pirated content, and such) which you have wrongfully misattributed to us event though the droplets you mentioned in them were already destroyed and no longer associated with our account at that time. We think the same error might have happened again today. Could you please double-check and let us know exactly what the problem was? ---Their response to our reply: Hi there, We've deemed the activities on the account are in violation of the DigitalOcean user agreement, and your account has been locked and disabled as a result. In ten days, your account will be terminated and your data will be permanently deleted. If you feel it is an error, please reply to this email. Regards, Security Operations Center DigitalOceanHello, --- So that's our personal experience with Digital Ocean. We used it for several years and were pleased with it (except some minor interruptions to their services and the fact that we never once got to talk to something that wasn't a chatbot) but if this the way they treat their customers we definitely can't recommend it, so if you wish to give it try good luck (you're definitely going to need it) PS. And yes, I do expect their little chatbot to auto-reply below this review about how willing their non-existent support department is to further investigate the issue with us."

So it is biting your tail and you end up paying minor amounts every month because it is impossible to disable a service.

Heine,DK,"Updated Apr 2, 2021",2,"Heavy spammer, but at least helpfull","First of all, I'm not a customer at DigitalOcean, however I have an equally bad experience with DO as many of the other reviews here, let me explain: I run a small family/business mail and webserver and as many others we receive a fair deal of spam/unsolicited mails, some days more than other and SpamAssassin usually takes care of the problem. Out of curiosity I tried loading the first 100 domain names from the spam folder to infobyip, a website that provides bulk lookup of up to 100 domain names/IP addresses. To my surprise, 95 of these 100 domains originated from DO's ASN #14061. I can see other reviews complaining that they block SMTP traffic, in that case it is quite strange that their system is so heavily overrepresented in my spam filter. Looking around the web I can see I'm not the only one getting attacked from DO servers, so for now the solution is to block the complete ASN #14061. That instantly removed 95% of the workload on my mail/spam fighting system (Postfix/SpamAssassin) I know this will also block legit users of DO, but I can only recommend them to switch to a more serious provider. Reply to answer: I have got some help regarding the spam, but not as stated in answer since i'm not a customer at DigitalOcean. For now I have raised my rating to 2 stars for at least trying to do something (and for a lot of usefull guides regarding fighting spam, even if a bit of irony is involved, considered the percentage of spam originating from DO themselves...)"

Sent a ticked the same day (it was June 30), they answered me only on Aug 27! I got a canned answer about their internal tools caught patterns associated with fraudulent behaviour. How this was even possible I don't know, since I didn't even had the chance to do literally anything. As of today, my account is still locked and I cannot even access the setting or remove my personal and payment information. I opened a ticket asking that they remove my personal and payment information and close/delete the account. Guess what? I never had any answer they just keep my personal data as an hostage, how is this even legal? And look at the cookie cutter answers they provide, someone from the marketing department, just go around the board here and there and copy and paste the same answers to reviewers, taking laziness to the next level. Worst service ever, stay away from those clowns, I would not go back to DO even if ""they"" pay me. I want my payment and private information removed and at Do nobody seems to care, they seems to lack motivation, so I will file a privacy complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada explaining the situation, maybe that can fix it. ===================================== UPDATE As expected, they answered to this post ""like they did for other post as well"" with the usual copy&paste answer.

Being a very small local company it would use < 100 emails per year - not even close to spam. They replied quickly (most likely an automated response) telling me they will not unblock Port 25 and suggested me to pay for additional mail services from other websites!

They've given me extension after extension, and when I miss the cut off and my servers get suspended they have them back up and running even with a partial payment.

Russ,US,"Updated Jan 14, 2021",1,Horrible POS,"Just signed up a client this week. They locked the account with a message saying they are going to delete everything in 10 days. Can't even retrieve any data. When replying to them, all you get is a generic message: Your account was found to match patterns associated with fraudulent behavior, which is a violation of our Terms of Service. After review, we have determined that restoring access to your account is not possible. What a waste of time spending the last couple days moving their sites over. I will be moving my own websites away from DigitalOcean as this is extremely sketchy. --- Update --- Contacted them upon their request and got the following: ""Thank you for taking out the time and reaching out to us in regards to the account lock - happy to look into it for you. We have reviewed your request and in order to ensure the best experience for our users, the lock on your account will stay as is for now. To ensure the integrity of our security systems, we cannot disclose which specific factors led us to this decision. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and we wish you the best in your future hosting endeavors."" What was even the point? So they will basically shut your account down without giving you a reason. What a crappy company."
Kyle,US,"Jan 12, 2021",5,Excellent services at reasonable costs.,"I signed up for DigitalOcean through their GitHub Education partnership, which gives all new users (who are students) $50 in free credit. This is equivalent to about 10 months of their cheapest Droplet, at $5/mo for 1GB of RAM, 25GB SSD space, and 1vCPU core. DO has been absolutely fantastic as a student, providing enough features for what I think is a reasonable price. It may not be the cheapest when you only factor in the cost of servers, but the benefits of DNS that updates almost instantly, domain name management, free static site deployment with App Platform, and more means that I was able to learn the basics of app deployment all in one space and very conveniently. I will definitely keep paying for this service because of all these extra features and the excellent dashboard experience, especially compared to the clutter of some other services I have used like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. However, I do have some cautions. For those new to this sort of thing, stay away from their web console. I'd rather they promoted another tool than have their web terminal available, since it's not very good (doesn't support copy and paste, for example). Additionally, for students and those working on smaller projects, I'd also recommend setting up databases inside of a Droplet, rather than opting for their base $15/month relational database service, which is quite expensive. However, I personally don't think this is a huge issue - if you need the databases at a larger scale, you're likely going to be happy about their data safety and backups, etc. Overall though, DO has excellent features, documentation, community guides and support (even for topics that aren't related to their platform), and in my opinion, offers compelling features for an extremely reasonable price."

However, there are plenty of competitors out there that are easier to use and do not have a brick wall / black hole approach customer support.

After I opened a ticket to close my account I was sent a response that had nothing to do with account closure. It stated that they had cofirmed my data and payment info. Then they reminded me that my account was suspected fraudulent and couldnt release any details. It is 12 hours after the account lock and they still haven't closed my account with 0 balance due.

LG,GB,"Updated Feb 17, 2021",1,I’ve seen adverts for this everywhere,"I’ve seen adverts for this everywhere. I had a task that required some non-stop horsepower that i couldn’t do at home as I usually do due to working from home in the current climate! Great, I thought - let’s get a droplet I keep reading about and do it there. Firsty, they gated me from seeing any of the plans before I paid money from my PayPal which I did. I then went to spin up the droplet I required and was met with a message telling me I couldn’t get it because my account needed additional authentication and to raise a ticket. The ticket asked me what I needed this droplet for - I explained and to their credit they got back to me fairly quickly. Their response however was shocking. I won’t paste the full email trail, but basically they told me they wouldn’t be giving me the droplet I wanted until I used lesser services. Upon challenging this as I literally have zero use for anything lesser, I was told they would let me do it if I deposited $500 into my account from PayPal. Even if I used what I wanted 24/7 for a month, it would cost $100. Well bravo on making sure you haven’t got my custom, I hope it was worth the unnecessary gatekeeping. I asked for my money back and went to Linode. Got what I wanted immediately. Would never recommend Digital Ocean service to anyone after my experience. --- Edit --- Appreciate reaching out after the fact to try and help me, but my accounts already been purged as per your own processes to get my refund.

SimplyTrackIt Dev,US,"Updated Dec 17, 2020",1,DigitalOcean deleted our droplet and all backups,"I hosted with DigitalOcean for about 5 years with no problem, faithfully paying with a credit card we kept on file within our profile. In November 2020, the card expired. Rather than bill me for the month of October usage on November 1, DO didn't even try to bill the card, because by their reckoning it was expired, even though the card was good THROUGH the end of November. Notifications from DO went to a mailbox we rarely check, and we rarely logged on to the DO server since it was a running an application that needed no attention. Thus we never received any notifications about the ""expired"" card (again, expired by their reckoning). BTW, we also had a mobile phone on file to receive texts for 2-factor authentication. Not once, did DO send a text alerting us to our past due balance. When December 1 rolled around, the now truly expired card should have missed its first payment. However, in the case of DO, it was now the second missed payment. On December 6 we found that our application wasn't accessible. Upon investigating, I realized that the card must have expired. No problem - I went online to provide the new card and to pay the two outstanding invoices. After waiting a few minutes more and still unable to access our application, I started investigating and found that DO had deleted our droplet and all backups. DO's response was, ""we're truly sorry for the inconvenience, but you are welcome to create a new droplet."" I thought, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Hell will freeze over before I use DO ever again. Other vendors would have simply frozen our data and system until the bill was paid. DO's policy appears to be one of vindictiveness. In other words, you don't pay your bill on time and we will punish you. We don't care that you've been a loyal customer for the last 5 years. That episode cost us an investment in a custom time-tracking system we developed at the cost of several thousand dollars and hundreds of man hours. It also cost us about $3,000 in lost billings, plus another 30 or so hours of time recreating as much of the time records as we possibly could, plus the embarrassment of having to explain to our clients what happened, plus the effort to find a replacement system. Do they care. Not at all. It's not their problem but rather someone else's. We've moved on, licked our wounds, and learned from the experience. I'm sharing my story to hopefully make others aware of the risk of doing business with DigitalOcean. Buyer beware."

Overall I've found them to be excellent, better priced than Amazon AWS that I also use, support is efficient and helpful, and reliability is good. There are more periods of planned maintenance than one might expect, however our monitoring shows these to have generally no impact. When machines have required migration due to hardware issues, this has also gone without a hitch, and DO have always been helpful in performing migration at a time we have arranged with them when that's been our request. Inevitably they are not going to be the most suitable choice for everyone, but if competent with server management, aware of the risks with any type of hosting and how to manage them, they should be an excellent choice.

Also look at their reviews I guess this site for scammers hosted by scammers sounds like a match made in heaven... Not sure if you read this here but. What the attack does is they send out mass text to random numbers. They claim that they are with a housing,help program, or financing. They want people basic info to grab that data sell it to other scammers or they use it them selves. I had a fake email and phone. That go hit by IRS, Microsoft, amazon, and apple scams on voice mail. There was no place to send files on their report system. So couldn't show them evidence. But after this I do not wish to speak to them anyway after them not want to do anything about it for week. I wouldn't recommend hosting with them."

They have literally deleted years of production data in our database and provided zero solutions when asked for support. Instead, we were preached about how to make sure we have our bank details up to date. Appalling customer support, no empathy, zero solutions, no apologies whatsoever - just erase history. If you are a startup, there will be no support at the other end of the line so you'd better be off with anyone else."

Of course, after confirming that our servers were running correctly, we lodged a ticket with DO requesting they review the network. Still waiting several days later... I moved our production workloads last night to another provider and, without any changes to the VPS or code (apart from living on a new server) everything is back up and stable. I certainly don't expect a system to be flawless, but several days without response to a critical networking issue makes them untenable as a hosting provider. We won't be going back."

KEEP READING PLEASE... I contacted them telling them to stop this, and that I will be happy to pay it doubled or tripled or even more, I don't care I just want them to stop this behavior, and for the record, I love to pay the services I use and I love to support others businesses (I'm that kind of loyal customer) BUT... unfortunately, we are just numbers for them, so someone of their support replied to my email saying: ""We apologize for the inconvenience... However, the most effective way to do so is to either pay off the balance and/or deactivate the account.""

It's up to you, but once you miss a payment of $1 you will see how happy they are to support you as you support them... some people forget where they come from and forget that without people they are nothing, sad reality, and there is no wonder if someone from their money greedy company writes me a comment with their ""We apologize..."" style, we are not stupid, people are smart, this is 2020 Anyone reading this, look at other comments here in trustpilot, you will conclude that they use the same pattern to treat people like junk, they don't care for anything other than your money, and don't listen to the very few 5 star comments, these people haven't faced any minor issue yet to see the other face of DigitalOcean. In the end, I think I can give DigitalOcean a decent advice (if they have someone to listen at all)... people don't need more ""fashion"" features... so instead of chasing new features, grab friendly humans and understanding people to serve us ""THE PEOPLE"" quicker and nicely, teach your staff that customer is KING ;) oghhh I know...

But I can actually understand why the negative reviews here. D.O. is not for everyone. It is targeted to Web Developers and technical people who know how to manage and set up servers. They also assume that you know how to log in and manage an account, keep your credit card on file, and how to cancel an account when you are done. Its called taking responsibility. (some people assume that if there is no traffic going to a server they should know you are done with it and not charge you!?) There is almost no reason to ever have to contact support. The dashboard gives you everything you need. Over the past few years I have hosted hundreds of websites and apps on droplets and spaces with no issues. Downtime has been zero. They are even proactive and update servers, letting you know weeks ahead of time of potential slowdowns or downtime, which I have not experienced. They are a very transparent company, letting you know of potential hardware vulnerabilities and when they will be fixed (like Spectre and Meltdown). Also, the people on here that were locked out, I am sure were locked out for a reason! That is to keep the rest of us safe and provide value for those of us with legitimate hosting needs. Thank you D.O!"

I got locked out of my account after getting a new phone and when the backup codes I had stored didn’t work, I had to submit a ticket. No reply. Other hosting companies have far better support so if that’s important to you, avoid DO. They assure me they are aware of the issues around support, but given the number of reviews that mention the lack of it, I’m not sure they’re nailing it.

I am considering taking legal action against DigitalOcean and I suggest everyone to STAY AWAY from such a horrible, despicable, and irredeemable company like them.

Michael D,GB,"Updated Jun 19, 2019",4,Great if you understand the proposition,"I feel like the negative reviews on here misunderstand the nature of DigitalOcean. It is not (and do not market themselves as) a managed hosting service with a great support system. It's true, the support is almost non-existent. I've used DigitalOcean for six years, and the only time I created a ticket, response times were very slow. But if you need lots of virtual servers of varying power and you are confident to manage them yourself, DigitalOcean is brilliant. It's cheap as chips and the user interface is elegant and simple. Deploy servers in under 1 minute! If you can remember web hosting in even the 2000s, this never gets old. Bottom line: if you're confident that you have the skills to manage your own servers, run your own disaster recovery setup, and want lots of power while keeping costs low, DigitalOcean is pretty much the gold standard."

Support could be more responsive and maybe a tad friendlier, but, hunting down solutions myself always leads back to DO docs, so yes, their real time support may lack in certain places but they provide more than enough manuals to get help which is amazing service in itself. The only downside is there are many other hosts who offer the same or more for much cheaper prices in todays market."
Jake Noble,GB,"Aug 2, 2018",1,Awful tech support,"If you have issues, such as a slow server or downtime they will offer no help. Just a standard reply to some FAQs about slow PHP (in my case). Despite proving that the issue was nothing to do with my code, even one page PHP pages that said ""hello world"" would go down. They did nothing. Avoid and use someone else."

Christopher Bennett,AT,"Jun 4, 2018",1,"Horrible service, don't care about their clients AT ALL!!!!","Ok, so I’ve been using DigitalOcean since 2013 and everything was just fine. An on May 31 2018 something really worrying happened, all my files got deleted and I received this email: “We sincerely apologize, however, there was an incident impacting the Spaces service that resulted in a number of Spaces and the data within them to be deleted. At this time we're performing a full internal investigation to determine what the cause of the issue was as well as why it happened. Once we have a full understanding and additional details to share, we'll follow up. At this time, unfortunately, we can confirm that the data within your Spaces has been lost and is not recoverable. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.” They never informed me further and none of my files were restore. No compensation except for $400 on my account, saying: “You have been granted credit to use on your DigitalOcean team for $400.00. We’ve updated your balance, which you can view at your team's billing page. Please note that this credit will expire after 12 months if it's not used.” I took severe loses… Now I am in the process of transferring to another service. Well, decide for yourself whether use their services, but I am really devastated by both my losses and their absolute ignorance."

Lonrika Ballard,US,"May 22, 2018",1,Digital Ocean is A Big Credit Card Scammer,"Please, do stay away as far as you can from Digital Ocean and all their promotional links, don't ever click on it and open an account. It is obviously just a super big lie, giving you no bonus at all. Do not trust their promotional event, whatsoever. Do not give them your CC number for verification because they will only charge you with $1 while the bonus they promised will never be arrived into your account even though they'd tell you that they've done so from their notification pop up window, but there will be zero $ still on your billing balance, no at all. And no support ticket answered. That's what they've done to me. I close my account and lose money for nothing on Digital Ocean Scammed Promotion."
Islam,TH,"May 8, 2018",2,Extremely poor support and service,"Tell me how should i contact my customers without email? Support did't give any chance to use outgoing smtp relays, even G-Suite accounts. They simply blocks any outgoing requests to popular smtp relays. Must wait 60 days before they review again your status. How can you do business without email these days? The only option they gave me is to deactivate my account and leave them."

""Thanks for reaching out, and sorry for the trouble there! I found some Droplets that might be using more than their fair share of resources, so I've taken action to mitigate the impact of that on other customers, and I'll follow up with our Trust & Safety team for some additional review. If you do run into any more problems, or there's anything else that we can help with, feel free to let us know. Regards, Platform Support Advocate"""

Ganis Santoso,KR,"Oct 22, 2017",4,Satisfied Long Time User,"I have been using them for 4 years for hosting. During those 4 years, I have minimum needs for support, everything's going well. When I needed support, they responded fast. I have great experience with them. But I would like to point out that I hope (1) they upgrade their server's performance and (2) they reduce their price. Currently, they are a bit lacking in those two points as compared to Vultr/Linode. However, in return you get more features and better UIX with DO."

Shoaib,GB,"Updated Aug 9, 2017",1,Ridiculous support,Ridiculous support. No phone support at all. We needed urgent assistance with our server and had to raise a ticket which they responded to after 2 working days without a solution. Completely unacceptable! Issue is still ongoing and after and still waiting for a response after over 20 messages. Better to use a chepa hosting service that provides phone support instead!

I responded within 5 minutes, fast forward 12 hours later and finally received a response saying that the iso had been added, I resolved the issue and asked them to remove the ISO, been waiting around 6 hours now for a response.

You wait for 5 hours for a response without any useful outcome. All this ends up in your site being down and you losing business. Easy to setup yes, for anything you regard as critical stay clear."

Sam M,GB,"Dec 21, 2016",1,Terrible service,Overpriced servers which can be tons cheaper if you go with other options. After using this service for a while I gave up due to the terrible service as they do not have a proper subscription with Paypal so they manually request money even though I thought they did and they didn't pre-warn me about it they asked for money for a service I didn't even use. Go with another service if you want a VPS.
Mr Lewis Cowles,GB,"Nov 4, 2016",5,"Affordable, ethical VPS hosting","So I've mentioned in another review that I don't use that supplier for VPS hosting. This is the company I use for my own VPS hosting. They are fast, feature-filled and friendly without being hard to reason about (like Amazon AWS). Also the cloud is a little like the evil guy from needful things, people give with one hand and take with the other. DigitalOcean has never done this, and through their customer engagement platforms I have learned how to use new skills and made suggestions that are now part of their platform. If you have a business, or want to play with the cloud from a safe-space. Try DigitalOcean, I don't think it's possible to regret as the costs are very low and predictable to get into."

Nick B,GB,"Nov 3, 2015",2,Very poor customer service,"The company emailed me to say they will start charging us VAT. We are a US company not an EU one and shouldn't be charged VAT. I contacted their customer service (ticket 806156) and was told I was wrong, they were right and that's that. They were totally unhelpful and couldn't give a damn about trying to fix the issue or provide a decent level of customer care. I'm now very bored of having to tell them they THEY are mistaken, but I guess it's a case of ""computer says no"". Therefore because of their poor customer service, I do not recommend DigitalOcean."

The dashboard is very easy to use, the hardware is top end, and responsiveness excellent. The resources allotted are generous and fair, at a very competitive price.

The community is great too; DO walkthroughs are how I got my server running VPN, Web, Proxy, Mail, and SMB services."

Ciril Kotic,SI,"Jul 10, 2014",5,Very good VPS provider,"They provide really nice VPS services, easy to set up and start working on.

I've been using their services for few months now, and it all went smooth so far. And hint: they're very generous with $10 coupons (google it)."
Henrik Strøm,DK,"Apr 4, 2014",4,Great value,"I use DigitalOcean for test, development and non-critical systems (critical systems run on Linode). You get great value at DigitalOcean - hard to beat a $5/month virtual private server."
