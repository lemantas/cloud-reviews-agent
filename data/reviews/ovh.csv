Toufik,FR,1 days ago,5,Infrastructure Built for Trust and Precision,"I’ve only been using OVHcloud for a short time, but I’m already impressed by the clarity and structure of their platform. As someone involved in diagnostics and global deployments, I value transparency—and OVHcloud delivers that from the start. While I haven’t yet tested advanced features like PTR record handling or MAC/IP block mapping, the documentation and control panel suggest a well-designed and professional infrastructure. Everything I’ve interacted with so far has been consistent, responsive, and easy to navigate. Looking forward to exploring more and seeing how OVHcloud performs under real-world load. So far, it’s a promising start. Thank you for maintaining such high standards. I look forward to continuing to build and deploy with OVHcloud as a cornerstone of my infrastructure strategy."

Mr Smith,GB,4 days ago,1,Good product terrible administration and support,"I've been with OVH for 9 years. I've had no problems with the actual product in that time. It has always worked well. What I dread is any interaction with their customer service and billing system because it's terrible. Their customer portal website looks impressive on the face of it but it just doesn't work properly. My latest problem, which is typical of the OVH experience, is paying for my renewal. First they told me that my automatic renewal had failed because I didn't have a payment method - despite the fact I've had the same card on my account for several years and never had a problem. It turns out that OVH had deleted the payment method themselves. I re-added it but I just get an error when I try to pay. My card is working fine everywhere else, my bank confirmed that they only declined one transaction from OVH (the automatic renewal) which was because the wrong expiry date had been used. The expiry date entered was definitely correct - it worked last year and I definitely entered it correctly when I re-added the card. Clearly there is (yet another) bug in their billing system. I raised a support ticket but the support staff don't read anything you tell them, they just keep repeating the same 'solution'. In their latest email they actually threatened to delete my account even despite me telling them three times that I am trying to pay but can't. And now there is a technical problem with their support ticket system which makes it impossible to update the ticket. I've really had enough. If you are looking for a cloud provider and have any sense you will go elsewhere instead of putting yourself through this."

MU Eagle,UA,5 days ago,5,Excellent Support from OVHcloud Claims Department,"I recently had an issue with my VPS (vps-ee4d74bd.vps.ovh.net) and contacted OVHcloud support. Thanks to Leticia from the Claims Department, my request was handled professionally and efficiently. The server was successfully replaced, and the previous contract was terminated as a one-time exception due to my specific circumstances in Ukraine, where the ongoing war has created very difficult financial conditions. The invoice was canceled. Communication was clear, and all steps were explained. I am very satisfied with the service and the level of support provided. Thank you for your assistance!

Zeus TL,ES,6 days ago,5,I recently had a case open with…,"I recently had a case open with OVHCloud under ticket CS11501282, and I can honestly say I am very satisfied with the way it was handled. The support team was patient, attentive, and willing to carefully review my situation even though it was a bit unusual. What I appreciated the most was that they took the time to understand my problem and, after some back and forth, they offered me a fair and helpful solution. It made me feel valued as a customer, especially since I’ve been with OVHCloud for several years. This experience showed me that OVHCloud doesn’t just provide reliable infrastructure, but also takes customer satisfaction seriously when challenges come up. Thanks again to the support and claims team for their professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile."

Florin,RO,Updated 4 days ago,1,Just avoid them,"Just avoid them. Purchased a VPS on Sep 3rd. Got an email some hours later that they cancelled my order for a vague reason: either inaccurate personal details, or related to the payment method. I paid with PayPal. I replied asking what else do they need. I proceeded to give them my zodiac sigh, eye color, and shoe size hoping they'll then be happy. I asked for either access to the VPS or a refund. It's Sep 8th now, and I've gotten no response, VPS, or refund. Very professional. I logged into PayPal to open a dispute only to find they didn't take the money but placed an authorization hold on the funds. If they cancelled the order 5 days ago, why didn't they release the hold as well? Jackasses. Reply to OVH’s reply: I responded to the info request with the account identifier. Curios what the reason for the poor experience is. Either way, for the record, I no longer want to purchase anything from you. I wasted enough time and energy on this."

Expect 20 HOUR RESPONSE TIMES to all support tickets (including server outages) UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO PAY A LOT MORE FOR PREMUIM SUPPORT LEVELS. The SLA's you see for servers/cloud instances at point of ordering on their website are NOT what you are getting as standard - YOU NEED TO PAY EXTRA TO GET THESE!"

pmulvey,IE,"Sep 2, 2025",1,Pathetic Customer Care Policy,"Support Ticket: CS11422741 (The printout of this ticket runs to 29 pages) On Fri. 8th Aug 2025 OVH issued an email offering me a free upgrade on my VPS. I immediately clicked on the link but it didn’t work so I assumed that I probably had to do a manual upgrade to the next higher plan myself for free. When a charge was levied I realised that this offer was not right. OVH sent a follow-up ERRATUM email a few hours later with the correct link. I raised this support ticket and the OVH response is simple. As a goodwill gesture they will refund my fee for the upgrade but since it is “technically” not possible to eliminate the charge at the next renewal I will incur that extra charge. The goodwill gesture identifies the mistake as mine despite the fact that I was misled by OVH. Today, 2nd Sept I sent an email asking that someone call me as I had a feeling that this Joanna B. might be an AI Bot. No so, Joanna B. is a real live person and she called me. She was very nice and did a great job for OVH implementing a pathetic Customer Relations Management policy. Bottom line is, I’m stuck with a plan that I took out having been misled by an OVH email. OVH is a big organisation but the amount of resources expended on this ticket alone would suggest that some form of early intervention was the correct way to handle this. My VPS is small beans in the greater scheme but I would be concerned if my experience of the OVH customer care philosophy would apply should I wish to expand to enterprise level plans and how would they deal with me? You would really wonder at the cost benefit analysis of not meeting customer expectations and being awarded a 1 star. I see that 50% of the reviews are 1 star."
Zakaria Benmoumen,MA,"Sep 2, 2025",5,thank you Débora P.,"Débora was very professional and helpful. She quickly understood the situation and provided clear guidance, reopening the service immediately while waiting for the payment confirmation. Her support was efficient and reassuring."
ahmed mohamed,EG,"Sep 2, 2025",1,"Unprofessional handling: out‑of‑stock after KYC, slow responses, and no prompt refund confirmation","I purchased a VPS on Aug 30, 2025 (Order #6917874). After payment validation, I was asked to submit full identity documents the same day; my account was then approved. Listing a product as purchasable while out of stock after collecting personal documents is unprofessional and suggests weak stock synchronization—especially given that the funds were actually captured on my Visa. Immediately after approval, I was informed the VPS had actually sold out and was offered either to wait “up to two weeks” or take a refund. On my dashboard, the status showed “The product is being delivered,” yet support said it was out of stock. I followed up multiple times on Aug 31 during the posted support hours asking for a same‑day solution (deliver the VPS or provide an equivalent/higher plan at the same price). The lack of timely, actionable replies led me to conclude the support was not reliable for my needs, so I requested a refund and decided to move to a provider with better support. On Aug 31, 2025 at 2:58 PM EDT, support stated that my cancellation and refund request was submitted. However, as of Sep 2, 2025, I have not received any refund confirmation or transaction reference (e.g., ARN), which keeps my funds tied up and wastes more time. This feels misaligned with their own terms about processing refunds without undue delay back to the original payment method. Important note: As of writing this review, I am still waiting for any confirmation or response regarding the refund. Bottom line: A vendor‑side stock failure after KYC, slow/no timely responses to repeated follow‑ups, and delayed refund confirmation pushed me to ask for a refund and move on. I hope they improve stock synchronization, provide firm ETAs during incidents, and issue prompt, documented refund confirmations (with references like ARN) to restore trust. also i can upload file containing all this emails between me and them when required"
Estevao,BR,"Sep 1, 2025",5,Happy long-time customer of OVH,"Decided to write this review regarding a recent experience (ticket #CS11494577). We've been using various OVH solutions over the past decade. varying from Dedicated Servers of all tiers to VPS. Throughout this period, we experienced only two outages, one due to a network connector failure in the first case and a disk failure in the second. Additionally, their customer service has significantly improved over this time. Even their response times for the standard support are short. We've tried alternative services on a couple of occasions and discovered that we were already using a solid, time-proven provider for our mission-critical services. If you know what you`re doing, go for the self-managed dedicated servers. If you don`t, get them to manage it for you. Also recommend checking out their Eco range for applications with lower requirements."
İsmail Sağlam,RO,"Sep 1, 2025",4,"Loyal customer, satisfied with outcome after upgrade","I have been an OVH customer more than 10 years and have recommended their services to many others. Recently, I upgraded to a higher-level, more expensive server and no longer needed my previous one. However, its commitment was automatically renewed, which was frustrating. At first, I was told it could not be cancelled early, but after review, the Claims Department made an exception and allowed me to cancel the remaining commitment as a gesture of goodwill. I truly appreciate this solution, as it shows OVH values loyal customers who continue to grow with them. That said, I believe OVH’s policies around automatic renewals and commitments can still be improved, as they can create unnecessary stress. While my case ended positively, I’m not sure the same flexibility would be offered to someone leaving OVH completely. Overall, I’m satisfied with the resolution and thank the team for their professional handling of my request. My Ticket Number is: CS11495198"

Hendrik,ZA,"Aug 30, 2025",4,"Not perfect, but very reasonable and functional","CS11443362 and others. I've been using OVH for >10years in various capacity and clients, but I can say that even though they aren't the cheapest, they aren't perfect, it was that 80-90% fit that suits the budgets. They don't have bleeding edge, but what they provided for me JustWorked(TM) most of the times. And the times it didn't they've been able to resolve it is reasonable times. For reasons I needed to move my servers to South Africa, and that is the sorry part that I were moving to a OVH-ZA. I'll advocate and use OVH when and were ever it suits my clients uses cases!"
Michele Maran,IT,"Aug 29, 2025",5,Best price-performance ratio on the market,"I have been a dedicated server customer since 2018. Recently i add a new dedicated server, migrating from VMWARE free to PROXMOX. At the moment to close the old server, Joanna (ticket CS11485211) kindly saved me from having to pay for early termination of the contractual commitment. Dedicated servers require a certain amount of technical preparation to take full advantage of them, but once configured, I've never had a problem that support hasn't resolved very quickly. Highly recommended."
Jack,AU,"Aug 29, 2025",4,Had a complex service delivery issue…,"Had a complex service delivery issue (Ticket #CS11474925) that required escalation to the claims department. Initial support responses were generic and didn't address the documented evidence I provided from previous tickets. However, once escalated to Leticia in Claims, the issue was thoroughly reviewed and resolved appropriately. The claims process worked as it should, though it required persistence to get there. As a long-term customer since 2018, I appreciate that they ultimately honored their documented commitments and resolved the matter professionally"

Arnaud Blanchet,ZA,"Aug 28, 2025",1,Poor support (CS11486736) and outdated webmail interface -,"I have used OVH email and web hosting services for years. I always received good support service when I needed it, except today. The webmail interface offered by OVH is outdated. Therefore I redirect my emails to a gmail account and I use the ""send as"" feature from gmail to send emails with the email address I created on OVH. The ""send as"" feature has suddenly stopped working and when configuring it again I get an error message that suggests that the issue comes from OVH server. The support team refuses to take a look at it and only offers as a solution to use the OVH webmail interface. It's disappointing to see that the only options are to use an outdated web interface or to not receive any support even when I submit the info regarding the error message received that seems to point to OVH servers."
Carlo M.,IT,"Aug 28, 2025",5,Ticket number CS11482746,"Ticket number CS11482746. I am really satisfied with the support I received from OVH and in particular from Joanna and Matias, whom I warmly greet and thank. I received very fast and precise feedback. OVH went the extra mile in fulfilling my request, which was admittedly a bit unorthodox, and decided to reward my loyalty as a customer by granting it. I thank the entire OVH Team and I highly recommend relying on their services, as their staff is extremely skilled and kind. Highly recommended A++ Great job guys, keep it up!"
Max,GB,"Updated Aug 28, 2025",1,Poor network quality and unsatisfactory support,"We use OVH and pay for premium support, but we periodically experience unstable server performance. All three of our servers simultaneously show high TTFB and packet loss. We have submitted multiple tickets, yet support does not always respond within the same day, even though they promise assistance within two hours for paid subscriptions. When we asked why, they claimed they don’t have enough staff. Despite our repeated requests to investigate the network issue, they make us perform tests, even though we are not system engineers. These tests are costly for us, and we do not want to hire an external administrator, as it is obvious the problem lies with OVH’s network. The proof is that the issue occurs simultaneously across all three servers at specific times. The agent Jonathan V., repeatedly closes the ticket without solving the problem, without even looking into the real issue, and without studying the evidence we provided. He has ignored all our screenshots several times and closed the chat while the problem remained unresolved. We are very disappointed with their service and support quality. Ticket number: CS11436095"
Adam Preece,GB,"Updated Aug 28, 2025",1,Worst company I have ever dealt with,"Worst company I have ever dealt with They try to trap you into their services by requesting documents that are not required on initial account opening . Then when you finally submit all the information they pass you on to other useless representatives who will request them again and again and you keep going around in circles! I have requested to terminate my account now, satisfied all requirement and for over 2 weeks they still are telling me they cannot close my account as they require information which I have already sent. Corrupt and shady customer services. I will never use or recomend OVH again , I have removed all my clients and partners are in the process of it too. Never again and avoid! UPDATE TO THE REPLIES FROM OVH!! I am fully aware of the active services , what you are failing to acknowledge is that the documents you requested , I had supplied you , and for over 2 weeks you were sending me support replies stating that you could not continue because you did not have the said documents , and you did! Your customer service representatives kept closing the case and were abrupt and kept repeating the same rubbish without acknowledging that I supplied the information. It even got to a point where you stated that I need to supply my username else you would not start the process which I sent you over 5 times!! You have misunderstood my requests time and time again. You actually still think I wanted you to close my account RIGHT NOW! When I just wanted confirmation that you will close my account and that no more payments would be taken out! You could not even give me that piece of mind. Your systems are full of bugs , even authentication is a pain as you have so many different sub domains on your automated emails that take you to the incorrect registered site. No matter how you try to spin this / justify your behaviour, you have lost customers that will never return. There is no excuse for the unorganised mess of customer service and my loss of time , even now wasting my time replying to you. But hopefully others will listen to this and avoid you! My account is finally set to be closed down and even though you still have not confirmed after 20 times being asked is this everything now , and no more further payments you still could not answer with out saying you needed to take primary support. In the end I have removed my payment method , contacted my bank and good riddance . I wish to hear no more from the like of OVH AVOID!"
Oscar Palomo,GT,"Aug 27, 2025",2,Good platform but misleading and no help,"Good platform but some information can be misleading, and you do not have a chance to see how it works unless you pay for that. If you realize this is not for you, thousands of providers offer a guarantee but not OVH they only reply that you have to read their terms and conditions. They do not care if you are an existing client or not."
MrSharc,UA,"Aug 26, 2025",5,web-hosting (shared hosting),"Let's start from the very beginning. I have been using the services of this company for a long time. The only company that really filters attacks at the network level (l3-l4) in europe and does not charge extra for it, although this protection has its own features and disadvantages and their prices are low. On August 16, I ordered web hosting (shared hosting) from this company for the first time. I was lured in by their advertising brochures. But it turned out that there is no protection at level 7 at all (not even basic options for limiting bursts, not to mention installing a captcha or calling a java script), and as a result, at one point the site simply stopped working. I was forced to write to support and request a refund, support is very slow, the billing panel is slow and unclear, a lot of unnecessary actions need to be done to write to support. But I want to note that technical support really confirmed my guesses about the complete lack of traffic filtering at level 7 and made a refund, as a result I received the entire amount back on 26 Aug 2025. Thanks OVH, I will take a VDS server from the new line and set up the filtering I need, although I will spend a couple of days on this. Ticket number for analysis: CS11447099"

Mohammad Adil,BD,"Aug 17, 2025",1,They Canceled My Order but Refused to Refund,"They Take Your Money, Then Ghost You. Be warned. My experience with OVHcloud was a masterclass in frustration. They will take your payment, cancel your order for a vague reason, and then make it impossible to get your money back. Here’s their playbook: 1. You place an order and pay. 2. They cancel it, citing unclear inaccurate personal details. 3. You follow their instructions to fix it and reply to their email. They ignore you. 4. You open a support ticket. They ignore that too. 5. Finally, they block you from their support system entirely so you can't even check your ticket status. It's simple logic: if you cancel an order, you refund the money or give clear instructions on how to place a new one. OVHcloud does neither. They just play hide and seek to keep your money. This isn't just bad service; it feels like a deliberate attempt to rob you. They just wait for you to give up so that they can enjoy the money. It's an absolute waste of time, and nobody deserves this kind of nonsense from a company that acts like a thief. Stay away."

Ale,FI,"Updated Aug 20, 2025",2,good service with bad abuse handling,"I have used OVH for a vps before for around 6 months and there were no complaints. What I do have a problem with however is their abuse procedures and processes, if it wasn't for this then I'd rate them 4 or 5 stars. Firstly, 99% of the email spam and brute force attacks I get comes from OVH since they dont block port 25. Secondly and the most annoying part, they also have no actual humans reviewing abuse cases, instead they just forward all abuse complaints onto their customers and rely on them to handle it. I have not received 1 response from an actual human regarding abuse cases. Do you think someone intentionally operating a mass email spamming operation or phishing page would willfully shutdown their operation when OVH forwards an abuse complaint over? No, they wont.

Lucas Nguyen,VN,"Aug 12, 2025",3,"Powerful specs at a low price, with some trade-offs","From my perspective, OVHcloud VPS is a good option for experienced users looking for a cost-effective solution. The biggest strength I've found is its incredibly competitive pricing, which is often much cheaper than other major providers, all while still offering solid specifications and unlimited bandwidth. However, there are some drawbacks I've had to consider. Customer support is quite slow, and it's largely self-service through documentation, which can be difficult for new users. I also find the network speed to be a bit of a limitation, as it's capped at 100Mbps—significantly slower than the 1Gbps offered by many competitors. Lastly, the complex and time-consuming registration and account verification process made my initial experience less than pleasant."

Customer support was instant and the operators were friendly, efficient and fast. Renewals took less than 2 minutes. This has been a great experience for our company!"

Wahid,AE,"Updated Aug 5, 2025",1,Abuse Team Issue,"Abuse Team Issue - Got a notification of 1 site infected with malware - We responded that the site has been removed and opened a ticket as we cant find the one they say there is in our own account: QQCMJQFMVM - Abuse Team decide to suspend the server at 5pm UK time - Been over 12 hours and no response - Talking to their live chat team - they cannot confirm whether the abuse team works on the weekend / says they do not have access to the abuse team and we need to respond to a ticket which is not in our account somehow So moral of the story, active clients need to wait 48 hours (potentially) to resolve an issue with 1 website which we have taken action on to make the server compliant and the abuse team at ovh are happy to leave for the weekend. Remember ovh - we were patient with you when your shipping containers were on fire back in the day and this process you have is bad with the abuse team. Update to OVH Response: Key points to understand are: 1. We had been responding to email about the abuse and missed JUST 1 2. The ticket number you sent and I sent in my initial complaint is NOT in our account - check the live chat I did on Friday - the live chat colleague admitted it is NOT showing in the account 3. The Abuse Team switched off the server on a Friday evening and are not working over the weekend for us to respond and deal with the issue during the weekend which means a BUNCH of legit customers have been down You guys just need to admit to a bad process and fix the process of not switching off servers on a Friday whereby there is NO ONE at OVH is there to help and work with to resolve the issue over the weekend. You will see in our account we have been a long standing client of OVH and having the abuse team separated from your support team and clients do deal with matters is what results you getting a 1 star review."

Always Fair,GB,"Updated Aug 5, 2025",1,Not recommended(without an anger),"First of all, the admin panel is poorly designed. I disabled auto-renewal weeks in advance, yet the system still charged me at the beginning of the month. Despite this, they refused to issue a refund. I’m not a novice, I’m an experienced user, and it’s clear their renewal settings are faulty. The domain wasn’t even pointing to their servers, so why would I keep it on auto-renewal? Even if we assume I somehow forgot to disable it (which I certainly did not), I contacted their support on the renewal date, and the service remained unused. That alone should justify a refund, and yet, they refused. Secondly, the VPS performance was disappointing. Despite having 8GB of RAM and a 4-core CPU, it was significantly slower than a basic shared hosting package. It was hosting a single PrestaShop site with very low daily traffic, so this is unacceptable. Lastly, the VPS came with a shared IP address that was already blacklisted on multiple platforms. This caused major issues with email deliverability, particularly with order notifications not reaching customers. REPLY: It has nothing to do with me. Your admin interface is not responsive enough. There may be a script interacting with the background database — I am not an expert to say exactly which — but whatever it is, it does not function properly. The cancellation request does not take effect and gives the customer the false impression that the command has been successfully processed. In this day and age, with a provider of your scale, no one would expect such a basic and frustrating error to occur. I never went back to double-check, only to discover later that it had not been cancelled when I was charged. On the very same day, I doubted myself and tried switching the renewal to manual. Right at that moment, one of the services — either the VPS or the cPanel — reverted back to automatic renewal again. That is when I caught the issue. One day, you will realise this mistake (if you have not already) and will regret blaming an experienced client. This is not about the money, of course. I could buy the entire OVH."

Though some improvements can be made on the turn around time for support tickets - and keeping a better watch on their customers (ab)use of assigned IP ranges - I feel comfortable to say that this company checks off every box on my list for a solid bare metal server provider.

Joseph,GR,"Jul 20, 2025",5,OVH support review,"We’ve been with OVH for over 8 years. We left Hetzner after some terrible incidents and never looked back. Our experience with OVH has been solid—excluding the major fire incident that happened a couple of years ago. To be fair, that was a big deal and quite a mess, but since then, all the new data centers have been built with multiple safety layers to prevent anything like that from happening again. Support has also improved significantly in recent years! Response times have dropped dramatically to just a few hours (this is with the standard, entry-level support plan), which is a huge improvement compared to a few years ago when we often had to wait several days or even call support directly to get anything resolved. The quality of support has always been high—our requests were never denied, and the support team was consistently polite, professional, and capable of resolving our issues. We’re writing this review because we recently needed to upgrade one of our servers. The existing server had a commitment for several more months, but support allowed us to move that commitment to the new server and even carried over the remaining credit (CS11336208)—no questions asked. So, thank you very much!"

OVH’s system simply failed to send the emails. I provided clear proof, including screenshots, that no emails were received. And what does support do? They just copy-paste the same useless response: ""We sent the emails."" No, you didn’t. Then they suggest I go manually recover the passwords for all 20 tenants - seriously? Why am I even using a reseller if I have to waste hours fixing your system’s screw-up? Their support doesn’t read tickets, doesn’t investigate, doesn’t help - they just bounce you around with canned replies. I’ve had multiple tickets now, and every single agent has been incompetent.

But there is a negative, if you have just the basic support plan, support takes days to reply. In addition i recently had something really annoying happen with a SoYouStart server. I cancelled the server, but their system still charged my credit card. It took weeks of talking on the phone/making support tickets explaining how it was on their end. Thankfully they refunded me the money that was charged. The process for cancelling servers on SoYouStart is unnecessarily complicated (done through an API that submits commands to their back end). Regardless, with the one problem i had over the course of all those years i'm still a customer - it doesnt change how amazing of a host they are! P.S. OVHCloud owns SoYouStart."

Alex,GN,"Updated Jul 10, 2025",1,You may lose your data with OVH,"Please note that you may lose your data with OVH when you decide to leave. I have been an OVH customer for over ten years. I put all my website data and my company emails on their platform. A few months ago, they started sending emails to renew my subscription, which had tripled. I paid so as not to lose my data, but despite this, they double-charged my account. I brought this to their attention after several discussions with their customer service representatives, and after informing my bank that OVH had taken money from my account without authorization, they initiated the refund process and decided to exclude me from their platform without recourse. They sent me an email saying that I could recover my database, but technically it was impossible; every time I tried, the system refused to download it. After a few days, they cut off my access to the system and I no longer have any access to my data. I reported the problem to them, and they said they had referred the case to customer service, then to technical support. To date, they have confiscated my data to make me pay for no longer being their customer. Be careful if you are looking for a service to host your websites or store your data. With OVH, you run the risk of losing everything if you do not agree to pay the fees they increase without warning. Look for a more serious and professional service. Update 1: A ovh representative reached out to me stating that i need to pay for another year to get access to my data. A few hours after another one reached out again and requested my case number , which i gave him. He said they will be investigating the case to understand what went wrong. Still on stand by.

Their service always offers really good products for the price. The only thing I miss from the previous years is the lack of official support for VMWare ESXi on their dedicated server although it works if manually installed through KVM/IPMI, with some quirks for their /32 public IPv4 address and out of subnet host route gateway. Unfortunately the day after we migrated some critical services from another cloud provider to a new OVH dedicated server, a datacenter incident took down our server for over 8 hours, interrupting our business operations. However the 99.95% uptime SLA policy was honored on the CS11269441 support ticket. After this I hope for a solid service for the upcoming years and also hope they bring back support for ESXi on the unmanaged servers, at least offering the required guidance and tools to make it work with their unusual public IPv4 address scheme. Finally I hope they further expand with a datacenter in South America, a service provider like OVH is really needed in this region."

They offer free credits to attract customers, but once you start transferring all your important company data to their servers, they suddenly suspend your account without any notice, claiming “fraud” without providing any evidence or resolution. I lost all my company data, including client files, branding assets, and critical business information. This has severely impacted my business and damaged our brand’s credibility. The support team is completely unhelpful, keeps going in circles, and provides no real solution. It's just a game of false promises and time-wasting. This is not just poor service; it’s deception. Avoid OVH at all costs if you value your business and data security."

OVH could provide a refund, especially for a service that hasn’t been used and was still within the 48-hour window, but after contacting support, I was told it’s not possible. Refunds are only issued if OVH fails to deliver the service within 48 hours, which is absurd.

John,US,"May 11, 2025",1,Your Data may become hostage,"I recently encountered a serious issue with OVHcloud's VPS service that I feel potential customers should be aware of. After missing a renewal payment, I immediately lost access to my data. Instead of providing a grace period or temporary access to retrieve my important files, my VPS was suspended pending ""full deletion."" When I requested access to my data, I was told I could only regain access after paying for the renewal effectively preventing me from retrieving my files unless I continued with their service. While I understand businesses need to enforce payment policies, holding customer data inaccessible without providing a reasonable opportunity to back it up first feels unnecessarily harsh. A more customer friendly approach would be to allow limited access for data retrieval before suspension. I've since decided to move to another provider with more flexible policies regarding data access during billing issues. If you value having reliable access to your data even during payment disputes, I would recommend exploring other hosting options."
xkalxm x,TR,"May 8, 2025",1,OVH CANCELING THE ORDERS,"At first, everything was fine. I purchased a dedicated server and it was set up in about an hour with no issues at all. Later on, I started ordering IP addresses every few days. Eventually, when I tried to place another IP order, it said ""additional verification required"" and that it could take up to 48 hours. About a day later, the order was canceled. That's when the problems began. When I contacted live support, they told me I needed to update my account information — basically giving me generic responses. Anyway, I updated everything and tried ordering again, but the same thing kept happening. I submitted tickets, and a support agent named Gabriel N. told me to place the order again and that it would be manually approved this time. I did that, but once again, it was canceled after 2 days. Just ridiculous. Since they started responding extremely slowly, I went to the Public Cloud section and activated a project. I placed around 100 small orders, and only then did they finally notice. Clearly, they only pay attention when it suits them. Then the system created a ticket saying I needed to upload documents. I had already told live support I was happy to complete a KYC verification if needed. The ticket said to upload documents via the ""My Documents"" section — which doesn't even exist in the customer panel. Total joke. I contacted live support again and they told me to send the documents in the ticket. So I did — front and back of my ID. Then they asked for proof of address, which I downloaded as a PDF from an official government website and sent it. I've been waiting for days now. This is honestly the most frustrating and ridiculous process I've seen. I'm an active customer, and you're doing a fraud check? For what? If this were my first order and I was using a VPN or something, I’d understand. But I’ve already been using your services. My service is close to expiry — what if I can’t renew it in time because of this mess? Will it be canceled too? Do NOT order from here. They don’t even know how their own system works.

Manpreet,CA,"Updated May 20, 2025",1,OVH is not a reliable server provider.,"Edited after OVH reply (20th May 2025): If you have seen the ticket carefully, then you might have seen screen shots of the email that I received from your abuse team. And if you have carefully seen the ticket, then I repeatedly asked that ""Please point out where is the technical detail in the email"" My only question that stayed for long is that where is the technical detail?"" If you have seen the ticket then you might have noticed that your team says they don't have access to abuse team. You take down a production server, and you say that you don't have access to abuse team. Is this not a shame on OVH? **** How was it fixed? ***** After days of research on internet I figured out that you don't have your own abuse detection system. You use Netcraft. I directly contacted Netcarft and they gave me issue number 68604359. After providing screenshots they agreed that they flagged the portal in error. You can see the issue if your fake abuse team has any access to them. Once Netcarft clear the flag, the next day I received an email from your fake abuse department that your ticket has been closed. Other than this they never replied to any email, even after updating my email address, as suggested by your so called support. --------- Original Review ------ We’ve been an OVH Cloud customer for over 11 years. Our leased server supports our tracking and communication software and serves around 3,000 GPS devices in a live production environment. On April 1, 2025, we received an email from abuse team claiming a phishing website was hosted on our server. As an immediate action I stopped the website. Still, on the third day OVH hijacked our production server. ** What was the business impact? ** 1. This server listens to approx. 3000 GPS tracking devices installed on commercial trucks and trailers. All of our clients lost connection with their vehicles. 2. Server hosts a communication system where dispatchers send live instructions to drivers on road. All clients lost connection with their drivers, and this caused missed deliveries causing financial loss to our customers. 3. Several other automations stopped. All of a sudden we had to migrate to a different server that we kept spare for urgencies. To understand the issue I created a support ticket and also called them to understand what was wrong. Support team told me to reply to the same email that was received from abuse team and assured that they will tell you. I replied to that email multiple times. But never got any reply from abuse team. I kept asking OVH support via tickets. But support kept saying that they don't have access to abuse team. Now we are in a business critical situation: 1. The domain they mentioned in the abuse email has nothing objectionable. It is a staging environment for testing our live application. 2. Because this domain was flagged by OVH, we have exact same web app running in production which we are keeping down because we are afraid of same wrong action on other server. ** What are we looking for? we appreciate that OVH does not allow phishing website. But the website they flagged is a normal web application used by our customers. Only those users can use them who were signed up by their employers. --We need to understand what was exactly on website that abuse system flagged the domain and hijacked our server even after the website was immediately taken offline. --We need detail, so that we could take care of objectionable things on several other applications running on different ovh servers. OVH team permanently closes tickets after stating that abuse team has provided sufficient detail. But abuse team just stated a domain name and nothing else in the email. To keep the conversation on, I create new tickets. I am keeping tickets open but they send a ready-made reply that they dont have access to abuse and ask to contact abuse team, but abuse team never replies. So for us OVH servers are no more reliable provider because they hijacked our business all of a sudden without any reason. They even do not explain what was the reason of hijacking a server. I am attaching all tickets and conversations and abuse email that, according to them, contains all so-called technical details. We request OVH to tell us what was phishing in the website."

I accidentally used their Canadian portal, and the order was cancelled due to a ""region mismatch."" Support told me to create a new account on the UK OVH site. I did exactly that — and again, the VPS order was cancelled, but this time the domain was accepted and charged, even though I can’t use it without a server. They refused to cancel or refund the domain, hiding behind ""registry rules."" I also can’t remove my payment method because there is now an ""active service"" (the domain I didn’t want). Total nonsense. This whole experience is ridiculous: You buy a service you can't use, you’re charged for it, can't cancel it, can't remove your payment details, and can't close your account unless you file a GDPR request. I’ve submitted a complaint to Nominet and will be requesting full data deletion under GDPR. OVH is a perfect example of how not to treat customers.

I was an external worker at OVH for 6 months. Right from the start, I felt isolated and unwelcome. There was little or no support or team spirit. I was often kept out of important meetings and communications, which made my job incredibly difficult. I still don't know why this reception was so negative. In addition to the loneliness, I was also openly harassed and defamed for no reason. I knew nobody. When I tried to express myself, my concerns were ignored. This created a toxic environment in which I felt constantly on edge and unsupported. To make matters worse, my personal and professionnal computers were hacked while I was working here. I still don't know how it happened, so I notified the security teams. But they didn't seem very concerned, which I find very strange. This job has taken its toll on my mental and emotional health.

Matthew,AU,"Apr 16, 2025",1,30 days downtime due to VLAN issues,Took a month to resolve an issue on their end with network connectivity. Gave us the run around and on multiple times had us repeat testing steps that required us to take down our production server. Despite using their Proxmox configuration guide they blamed us for the issues and gave conflicting messaging about what they were actually doing to investigate it on their end. Sadly could not recommend their services in you need reliability and a service provided with due care.
Determinism,TR,"Apr 12, 2025",1,They dont let me cancel the commitment,"I ordered an VPS from them. But mistakenly I accepted the commitment and now they don't let me go for 2 years of period. They say If I do cancel my commitment, I still have to pay the remaining months bills. There is no way to don't pay. In my country Turkey It's illegal to commit people and get the all of services price. If I want to cancel the commitment, they must only charge me for discounts they offered. If I change my payment details and don't pay the rest of the bills...but they are legally bind you to commitment. I don't know If they can sue me for don't paying the committed bills. But it's just a one click and now on you are bound to the commitment and it's for 2 years. They are absolute scammers. And I don't get it that some company from France can do such illegal commitments. How France officials let them continue their fraudulent business. I guess money is sweat, even if it's from fraudulent business."
Luca,GB,"Apr 11, 2025",1,Inconsistent policies and poor customer experience,"OVHcloud's account management is a joke. You can create an account in minutes without any ID or verification—no questions asked. But when you try to delete an empty account you no longer use, suddenly you're asked to submit legal identification. Support bounces you from form to form, quoting GDPR articles out of context, only to later say you could have done it from the customer area all along. It's not just frustrating—it's a clear sign of a company more focused on gatekeeping than providing actual support. Terrible service, confusing processes, and zero empathy for users. I’m done with OVHcloud, and I’ll make sure my clients are too."

Sasan,TR,"Apr 9, 2025",1,"OVHcloud – Vague Accusations, No Accountability, and Zero Support","I have been dealing with OVHcloud’s support team regarding an unresolved issue dating back to October 2022. After multiple follow-ups over the years, OVHcloud finally replied — and their response was completely unsatisfactory. What happened? I ordered several VPS instances back in October 2022. Shortly after payment, my account (formerly is151300-ovh) was locked without warning. I promptly provided all requested documents (government-issued ID and proof of billing), yet my account remained inaccessible. Despite clear bank records showing full transactions (not just pre-authorizations) for amounts totaling 1,991.12 TRY on October 19, 2022, I never received any refund. For over two years, every inquiry resulted in generic replies claiming that only a pre-authorization had been made. My recently created account (using the same email) was also locked without any explanation, leaving me completely without support. OVHcloud’s latest response claimed: My account was disabled because of “illegal activities” on my server—an accusation made with no details, evidence, or even a single log shared. Their explanation was vague, citing “security reasons” and stating the decision is “final and unappealable.” They continue insisting that the charges were only pre-authorizations, despite my solid bank documentation showing otherwise. What’s even more frustrating? I have no direct access to a support representative. Every time I’ve requested detailed explanations or tried to escalate the matter, I’ve simply been told to “raise your complaint,” with no actual assistance provided. The lack of accountability and transparency from OVHcloud’s support team makes it nearly impossible to have my issue resolved, and I feel completely abandoned as a customer. Final thoughts: If you’re considering OVHcloud, be aware that if something goes wrong, you might not only lose access to your account and funds, but you may also face a wall of vague accusations and zero support. I urge OVHcloud to address these issues and for potential customers to be cautious"
Sarah Conner,US,"Apr 7, 2025",1,They aid in sexual abuse.,"They are sharing my non consensual imagery across many of their websites and when notified, they would rather help the criminals than the actual victims in this situation... they're the only hosting company that refused to comply with taking down this sexual abuse imagery."
Olivier D,GB,"Updated Apr 8, 2025",1,"The worse customer service experience, ever.","Mame D. of OVH asked me to review their service, well... here you go, short and sweet: AVOID them at all costs! I have been asked to quote the ticket reference, here they are: CS10769529 & CS10960112. This way OVH can check and come back here to tell the world why this review is unfair. Honestly, be my guest OVH, I'm so done... Now, here is my experience: A couple of month back I spot a domain name I want to purchase, see it is available and start the process of purchasing it together with a web hosting, using OVH. The order is easy, everything is wrapped up fairly quickly. Then I start receiving some emails about my order, all looks ok. A few hours later, when everything things to be in order, I try to install a module on my website, apparently things are done promptly, all good. However, nothing shows on the website, I cannot access the module but instead see another landing page telling me that the domain I thought I owned was available for sale. I look back at my order, yep, I did try to purchase said domain. Investigating further, I understand that the domain was grabbed by a domain broker a few minutes before I did purchase it. Frustrating, but such is life sometimes. However, since I can buy the domain on the secondary market for a reasonable price, I do that. Once I fully understood this situation, I reached out to OVH customer service to raise this issue and the fact that AT NO POINT of the order process, or after, did OVH highlight that they could not give me the domain I ordered. Then, after I raised the issue, at no point did they investigate what happened and acknowledge their failure. Because I got rather insistent that they were at fault here, OVH said they may (!) refund me the cost of the hosting (which is actually roughly equivalent to the cost of the domain on the secondary market). They did tell me that, should the refund be approved, it could take up to a month... A good month after that declaration, nothing happened, no follow-up, no refund. So I chased. Tadaa: today, they refunded me and deleted my hosted website, suspended my DNS zone, just wiped out everything. Again, AT NO POINT did they say that, should they refund me, they would effectively disable all the services and throw me out. But they did it, the lovely people... see, they can be efficient sometimes. So, back to you, gentle customer, beware. You may need a lot of patience with OVH and maybe more than that. I used to be a happy customer of theirs but I will now migrate the various websites I held with them for many years to another platform, with better reviews than OVH. EDIT: As announced, OVH try to show they care, even though they don't. Not only they clearly glaze over the issue linked with their failing process, but they do not commit to change it and, best of all, they make it sound like it was fully clear they would cancel all services. Whilst I requested a 'commercial gesture', they 'offered a refund' which is in fact the cancellation of all services with the necessary refund that goes with it, which is a legal requirement. Honestly, if you haven't already just avoid them like the plague."

C’est un dossier juridique majeur : § 434 BGB (droit allemand) – défaut de conformité § 323 BGB – droit de résiliation § 5 UWG – publicité mensongère Directive 2005/29/CE – pratiques commerciales trompeuses Loi britannique & droit international du consommateur – violés 📂 Preuves : captures d’écran, site archivé, conversations support ⚖️ Procédures PayPal lancées 🔔 Si OVHCloud ne réagit pas immédiatement, je déposerai : Une plainte pénale pour fraude (article 263 StGB) Un signalement aux autorités de protection des consommateurs Un communiqué public adressé à la presse OVHCloud n’a plus d’excuses.

Update – Fall wurde gelöst Nach längerer Auseinandersetzung wurde mein Fall durch OVHcloud mittlerweile vollständig gelöst. Die Rückerstattung wurde durchgeführt, die betroffenen Server wurden entfernt, und der Fall ist damit aus meiner Sicht abgeschlossen. Allerdings möchte ich auch transparent festhalten: Ohne den öffentlichen Druck auf sozialen Netzwerken, umfangreiche Dokumentation und die Weiterleitung an die Claim-Abteilung hätte der normale Support das Ticket vermutlich weiterhin ignoriert oder geschlossen. Die ursprünglich beworbenen Eigenschaften der Server waren tatsächlich nicht wie beschrieben verfügbar – das wurde mir später auch schriftlich bestätigt. Dass es erst dieser Eskalation bedurfte, bleibt schade – aber ich anerkenne, dass OVHcloud letztlich reagiert und die Rückabwicklung ermöglicht hat. Ich hoffe, das Unternehmen nimmt diese Fälle künftig ernster – im Sinne der Kundenzufriedenheit und Rechtskonformität. Update – Case resolved After an extended dispute, my case with OVHcloud has now been fully resolved. The refund was processed, the affected servers have been removed from my account, and from my perspective, the matter is now closed. That said, I want to be transparent: It sadly required public pressure, daily documentation, and escalation to the Claim Department to reach this outcome. The servers I ordered were not compatible with the features advertised, as OVH later confirmed in writing. It's unfortunate that such escalation was necessary – but I acknowledge that OVHcloud ultimately acted and allowed a fair resolution. I hope they take similar customer issues more seriously in the future – in the interest of transparency, accountability, and legal compliance."

Above all, compared to other companies that provide similar products, the experience from purchase to post-installation use is good.

Even though I have been a customer for over 10 years, with hundreds of thousands of euros spent as a customer, the request to terminate a server, which occurred due to hardware failure, is not taken into consideration and they want me to pay for a server that will not be used. OVH needs to worry about serving its customers better, because a decade-long commitment relationship is worth more than a simple $80 contract compared to the thousands of dollars invested as a customer."

We set up hosted exchange with you on Monday, with the surprise that our order needs 48 hours processing time.

The support agent on the phone explained to us that the 48-hour check only occurs the first time and not for subsequent orders. With this confidence, we bought the necessary hosted exchange licenses on thursday (yesterday), trusting that the order would go through immediately. And we ended up in the 48 hour check again!!! We absolutely have to make the migration today (Friday 21.03.25) as our contract with the old hoster expires at the weekend. I have contacted telephone support twice today and chat support twice and they don't want to speed up the validation of our order.

Emmanuel dC,JP,"Mar 20, 2025",1,"Give them dozens of thousands of $, they'll treat you like sh*t","If you enjoy being treated like sh*t by a company you give dozens of thousands of dollars or euros, go for OVH Cloud! that I started being an OVH customer back in 2000, ie 25 years ago. In total, through my various companies, I've given them a few dozens of thousands euros. Last year, we received an email from them stating that they unilaterally cancel one of the servers we pay every month, because on January 1st 2025 they would close the data center where it's located. In December, they sent us a follow-up urging up to migrate to another server, and providing a discount coupon in order to make up for the trouble. So we invested quite much time (ie money) migrating to a new OVH server, that is more expensive than the previous one. Yet, in the first days of January, they charged us again for the old server that they actually terminated! I wrote to them, they apologized and said that this server was still totally operating, because they changed their mind and decided not to close the datacenter. But they didn't think that maybe it would have been smart to let their customers know, so that they don't waste time and money!! As a way to apologize for the trouble and refund what they charged us for a server that was supposed to be cancelled, they credited us one month of rental on a new server. Also, we decided to commit for one year on the new server, in order to fully use the discount coupon that they provided us (valid for 12 months). But when committing for one year, the discount was not taken into account. Their support told us that it was only a display bug, and that after the one month they give us for free the amount they will charge us would include the discount. This is not what happened. They tried to charge us 300 euros more than they were supposed to charge us, because the amount didn't take the discount into account. Luckily, the transaction was blocked by our bank because of its amount. We immediately contacted their support and told them about their mistake, so that they can fix it and charge us the correct amount. That was 5 days ago, and despite two follow ups they still even haven't replied. Even worse: last year, we received an email from them stating that the server would be suspended if we don't make the payment ASAP. But this still links to a page with the wrong amount, so they haven't fixed anything. Oh, and I forgot to mention but to give you an idea of how unreliable and unprofessionnal they are: when we initially ordered this server, it was advertised that it would be delivered ""within 72 hours"". In the end, it took 5 days! In the end, OVH Cloud was a great company in the past, but all this story shows how terrible this company has become. You should defininely avoid them and work with a more reliable partner."

Adam Wojciechowski,PL,"Updated Mar 27, 2025",1,Non-existent support.,"Non-existent support. My dedicated bare-metal server had a 2 hour outage yesterday. I noticed it myself 20 minutes after it started. After failed restart, I received email saying ""it will be solved in couple of minutes"". I have also sent a ticket. And here's where trickery starts - my ticket was set to priority 3 (even though it was complete server outage). I had no influence over that priority. And their TOS say that SLA is only relevant for priority 1 events (which as it seems I'm unable to report) and that it only starts after report. So basically SLA is worthless, as their system will not allow you to send priority 1 ticket. But that's not all. There has been no activity on any of my 2 tickets (I tried another time hoping that priority 3 is a mistake), but server came back online. Shortly after I received email which liked to page, which claimed ""outage was due to SCHEDULED maintenance of [electric systems}"" and that ""affected users were notified in advance"". No, I wasn't. Now, 14 hours later - my tickets are still waiting for any reply/action. at 9:39 (12 hours after issues started) I got email which says somebody is looking into it - but it seems 2 hours is not enough for person supposedly taking care of it to figure out server is fine now. The only place, where I got response was their facebook, where I got same template message, as many people are getting on their reviews here - 12 hours after outage started. There is absolutely no way to contact any tech support. All messages, calls are ignored for hours. This is absolutely unacceptable for any business site/application. Disclaimer: outage was complete, server was unreachable by any means (KVM, SSH, Serial over lan, rescue system). It's my first and last business with ovh. Once prepaid term is over, I'll be moving over to hetzner. ADDED: From discussion with OVH it turns out, that their SLA and response times are simply a lie. Copied over from their message: ""For your information, please note that there will be a delay of 24:00 to 48:00 when you create a support ticket."" This means if your server is down, you'll have to wait 24 to 48 hours for them to even start looking into it... To OVH reply: Yes, they replied to tickets after 24 hours. They didn't even figure out that tickets WERE placed during outage, so congrats on ""solving"" tickets AFTER issue was no more. And I did not receive any notification in advance about the outage. Again, their reply shows very well how much their ""SLA"" and ""guaranteed response time"" is truly worth. Also, terms and conditions clearly states, that their reaction time should be 1 hour - not 24 or 48 hours response time they keep referring to in their answer to this comment (Rise dedicated server)."

Edgar Ibarra Sarceno,PH,"Mar 3, 2025",1,Horrible customer support SCAMPANY,"Horrible customer support. Instead of answering my questions gave me a knowledgebase link then disconnects the chat when I asked to cancel the service. I have to be disconnected twice. The third rep which was my first rep that disconnected me earlier, instead of doing my request gave me a bad link for the knowledgebase. Had to just look for where you can cancel. Also they dont give refunds even if it was just charged today and i have not been using it for 3 months."
Milan Moerman,BE,"Mar 3, 2025",1,Service,"I started using OVH a couple years ago, didnt think very much of it... wanted to cancel some of my services. There was my first problem with OVH, it wouldnt allow me to cancel my own services i was paying for. Very hard to figure out how to do it the correct way. The user interface is not user friendly at all! U can go on a cancellation to cancel 1 of youre srevices and it would give an error. But you can also request a deletion of youre services then get an automated mail with the same cancellation form and that is the right way to delete 1 of your services. very unfriendly for users. And if u want to ask customer service? Good luck with finding an email u can write to. All the phone numbers they provide are very expensive. So now i got billed 55 euros for a service i didnt use for the laste 1.5 months... just because the customer service is so hard to reach out to and the correct cancellation form is way to hard to figure out how to get there. I will probably not get a refund, because u can already guess... the customer service is unreachable or very expensive. OVH, if u read this im a very unsatisfied customer and wont be comming back to u if i need services in the future!"

Pierre-Louis,FR,"Feb 28, 2025",1,The hosting is slow and support null,"The hosting is slow. Very often the backend of my wordpress just hangs for minutes. Or just give me server500 errors. Even before launching my website, ie when no one else than me was trying to connect to it. Now I have about 100 users, and they just can't reliably download a 500mb file. It keeps failing. I bought their CDN option, because I thought it would improve the situation. But nothing changed. No clear documentation to explain how to set it up. And the worse, what really get them 1 star is the customer support. Forget about it ! You try to contact them, they have setup a wall of chatbot / fake chatbot / fake ticket submission forms / various pages redirecting you in all directions. The goal? Very simple: Discourage you from contacting them. You will try and it is going to make you mad. Because wherever you click you cannot reach them. But don't worry, their useful chatbot will redirect you to whatever unrelated FAQ."

Darren Birks,GB,"Updated Mar 26, 2025",1,False spam abuse claims,"So was using OVH for some time (mixture of dedicated and VPS) Recently I started getting emails that one of my VPS's was the source of spam. Naturally I investigate and find nothing. I shut the VPS down but the emails keep coming in. The spam seems to be referencing a domain that for some reason still point to the IP of my VPS and this domain is hosted by OVH. OVH keep mailing me with abuse of service threats despite this been nothing to do with my machines. There support are useless because they tell me to reply to the emails - which I have been - with no replies. Ironically the only spam I can see is the number of abuse tickets coming in from OVH. I actually had to add an auto filter to my gmail to block them. Terrible service, and I will be migrating all my services elsewhere. UPDATE: Despite requesting (and me supplying) more information I got no further contact from OVH. Tickets I open just kept getting closed with telling me to contact there trust/safety department - who never reply. EDIT: No everything is not ok - I still have hundreds of scammers domains pointing to my IP on your DNS servers which you are refusing to remove. I do not use X or facebook so cannot continue there."

Muz S,IN,"Updated Feb 27, 2025",1,Dedicated Server abruptly deleted. Support difficult to reach & get,"I have been OVHCloud advanced dedicated server customer since 2023 Last week my server was deleted and I received message 'In accordance with your request, the server has now been deleted. This operation is irreversible.' No I did not make request to delete. But, I intended to continue service. I was having errors in payment, but finally I received message that payment processed. But the service(server) was abruptly deleted within week, without giving notice, message or opportunity to continue. This happened while I was engaged in personal emergency situation. Server service was decent, but after deleting service it has been very difficult to reach support to get service restarted or recover important data lost due to abrupt action without consideration for impact on the customer. The interfaces, especially related to support just keep redirecting without letting you in, and I am not even able to create support tickets. Looks hopeless situation. Dedicated server service was acceptable. But systems and interfaces, especially related to crucial customer support are very frustrating and appear flawed. I am willing to restart with new server, but would be needing data from old server which has abruptly gone now, making it experience to mourn. ----------------------------------------- Update [20 Feb 25] : Thank You Maxime.R for your attention and reply. I have provided requested information couple of days ago. It serves to have got connected with responsible representative, and I am hoping that needed assistance would be provided quickly in this critical emergency situation. ----------------------------------------- Update [22 Feb 25] : What makes OVHCloud interface confusing and frustrating is that user gets transferred to subsidiary sites of different countries 1) I noticed that while OVHCLoud presents me login screen for customer account, I can login from sites of certain countries like canada, else my login does not get validated. (Which was not issue earlier) 2) For support ovhcloud kept me redirecting to GB site, where I could not login for support. Now I can login from Canada site 3) But as my services have been deleted, I can not create support ticket for relevant deleted service. It would have helped if there was way to create general support ticket. 4) Payments redirect to US site. Payments may get processed, without creating charge on account. Flawed. And then my service got deleted. ----------------------------------------- Update [23 Feb 25] : I have submitted requested details again on 20th Feb to do checks (Customer Account sm530267-ovh, which was mentioned on this review since 18th Feb .. 6 Days since then now). I request to provide needed assistance ASAP. I request to restore deleted dedicated server. Or help me with data recovery from the deleted server. I have many off-site backups, but I also lost critical on-site data in server deletion done in confusion. I need to setup my server & services immediately now. There has already been loss of many days. ----------------------------------------- Update [27 Feb 25] : Any checks done related to my requests? I've also provided my email. I've received no communication so far."

This month, OVH suddenly closed my account, citing a Spamhaus complaint that had nothing to do with me. Despite my attempts to clarify the situation, their support team provided no real explanation or resolution and their abuse team doesn't answer. They chose to shut down my account without warning or investigation. No due process, no appeal, just an abrupt termination—effectively locking me out of services I paid for. If you're running critical infrastructure, think twice before trusting OVH. They can terminate your account without proper evidence or a fair chance to defend yourself. Their handling of this situation has been unprofessional, and their customer service is non-existent. Avoid OVH unless you’re willing to risk losing your services without justification."

Technical support is only available via extra payment which i am fine with, however if you can't even access your account the customer service team should be bending over backwards to help you. I find it totally un-reasonable that they would treat new customers that way and I would highly recommend thinking about using them. Not polite, not very freindly and the attitude that they are doing you a favor by providing you the opportunity to give them money. STAY FAR FAR AWAY. Again all because we had an assistant sign up for the service in advance for planning, then the link expired after 7 days. You are on your own now. That isn't normal."

Brillian Esa,ID,"Jan 28, 2025",1,Account Suspension and Server Shutdown…,"Account Suspension and Server Shutdown in Just 3 Days Incident Timeline: Account Creation – I created my OVHCloud account on January 24, 2025. On the same day, I purchased a Dedicated Server (ns5190**.ip-192-99-45.net). Three days later, I suddenly found myself unable to log in to my customer panel. My Dedicated Server was suspended due to an alleged unpaid invoice. Typically, hosting providers allow a reasonable grace period before suspending services due to non-payment. However, in my case, the suspension happened just three days after the purchase, which is unusually fast and highly inconvenient. I was never notified about any pending payments before the suspension. Losing access to both my customer panel and server without warning is highly frustrating, especially for a newly purchased service. My experience with OVHCloud has been extremely disappointing. I expected better service and communication regarding billing. Instead, I faced an abrupt account restriction and service suspension with no prior notice. I hope OVHCloud can address these unfair suspensions and improve their billing transparency. For now, I cannot recommend their service to anyone looking for a reliable hosting provider."

Katerina Kulhankova,CZ,"Updated Jan 26, 2025",1,I warn against this hosting! it is dangerous!,"I warn against this hosting. For someone who is dependent on a hosting it can be fatal! This hosting is cheaper, but you can repay for it like we did. As I can see by the reviews here (I find that Trustpilot trustworthy) almost all the others have a similar experience as us: OVH is great for hackers and anyone who wants to harm others. It is enough to write to OVH claiming there’s something wrong with someones website, and OVH, without any verification of whether it’s true or not, will shut down all the services without any prior warning. That's what happened to us. When we requested proof of the existence of malicious code, an analysis, or any evidence showing how they believe or verified the claim, we received only a clearly generic email response completely unrelated to our query, like “we’re talking about one thing, and they’re replying with something entirely different.” If you find this hard to believe, here’s a quote from the email telling us they're shutting us down: *""It has been brought to our attention that you're hosting a phishing webpage on your service ns3192371[.]ip-135-125-189[.]eu. Regarding the abuse (Phishing) reported to you on your service ns3192371[.]ip-135-125-189[.]eu, we are forced to put your service offline to stop the abuse.""* ...they mentioned one url of our web. There is no malicious code on our website. We’re a reliable online store (20 year history, 1700 reviews on Trustpilot with rating 4,7), and we thoroughly checked the entire site, especially the specific page mentioned. Nothing suspicious was found. OVH provided no specific details and kept repeating the same nonsense, essentially saying: “Someone said there’s something wrong with your website, so we shut it down.” OVH is essentially a perfect support system for hackers—a method for taking down someone’s website and putting it out of operation. All you need to do is send them some made-up nonsense, and they’ll shut down the target website. We have pay for the hosting **€3,000**! Imagine that—a cheaper hosting service must be even worse....while anything worse is hard to imagine. Of course, we’ve switched our hosting elsewhere. We’ve suffered a big loss because our online store was hosted on this service, and we will sue OVH for the lost revenue and the damages and expenses caused by this. UPDATE 26the of January: Our OVH account ID is:bv194584-ovh We have sent SEVERAL emails to OVH emails and links. We were asking for datails, any informations but we only have received ""automated and ""formal"" answers from OVH. Out ticket ID: Ticket #ABUSE_ZJGTNDKRMV), which we have written into the email subject and we sent it to: ZJGTNDKRMV.6920@abus.... (emails are not allowed to enter here] We got any answer which answer the basic question where OVH abuse team sees some non-compliant code. Because there is nothing like that as far as we analyzed. We also informed OVH about the damages and losts caused to us. Although we sent several requests, we did not receive any answer except some automatically generated general answers (with no information value). how suprising is that the only normal non-automated response we received from OVH is here on this review!

We were fairly happy with them nonetheless, but stopped using them in May and wanted to take a break. This also means we cannot login to their customer support center. It also means that we can't login to the helper center 95% of the time. sometimes we are lucky, but its months apart. always just ""Invalid account ID or password"". And no way to get help. If we create a new account to contact them, they say they can't help. Sometimes we have been able to log in, but when we contacted customer service, they didn't want to help us cancel our services, so we had to figure it out ourselves. Took hours, and many emails (they don't respond to emails though), help from chatgpt, google etc. and support chats with their dumb AI agent. The chat also never works. But anyway, I finally figured out how to cancel my services in November. After paying almost $1000 since the first time we asked to cancel our services. Now it's january, and they just invoiced me a full $150 (our monthly charge) again. So i guess we only could cancel our things in november, and they're charing full for december again. And going forward, of course. It's impossible to close our account, and impossible to stop our services. the dashboard isn't working properly, the login isn't working. customer support is not responding and their chat is not working. The chat always says This option is currently unavailable. We recommend that you open a ticket using our Helpcenter help.ovhcloud.com. And we will respond as soon as possible. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience. and the link doesn't work. So that's great. We will have to cancel our credit cards and i'm excited to see what's gonna happen when they keep invoicing us :-) Stay away from this company."
Ian,RU,"Updated Jan 14, 2025",2,If you paid for the service it doesn't mean it will be delivered,"UPD My user account was successfully erased and I got a refund now, after 14 days. I still don't like that it wasn't clear why I didn't get the services and why the system didn't mention that the refund whould be made. However, now I don't think the OVH is a scam–they brought my payment back. UPD2 Dear DieynK who replied on behalth of OVH. Sorry, I can't reply to you in the comments (there is no such a button on my side) so I'm writing to you here: Thank you for the willingness to help. Here is the support ticket number I created for the account deletion: CS10606205. Maybe it will help ti investigate the case somehow since the account data has been deleted already. The initial review: Got my money – didn't provide the service – didn't make a refund I ordered a vps and paid the money for it. It turned out that I didn't get the VPS after the payment–ovh said that I should wait for two more days while they'd be checking the order. After one day, the order was declined with no clear reason (I've never used ovh before so I couldn't physically violate their rules + the money have been withdrawn). Moreover, the money I paid are not shown as a balance–so they are not refunded or dropped to the account neither. They just disappeared. Weird scam. BTW you can't even delete your account yourself–you need to ask their support team for that. I've just created the request to make sure they won't have any access to my data in the future."

Sapu TSM,US,"Dec 28, 2024",1,Charged for Deleted Instance and Given Runaround from Support,"I'll start by saying I was a mostly happy OVH customer, and while I'm certainly far from a large customer, I was spending comfortably in the 5 digits with them annually for many years. All my usage within the past couple of years has been on their public cloud offering. At the end of October, 2024, I went in to clean up some instances that I was no longer using so I wouldn't continue to be charged for them. I tried to go in on the 30th to delete them, but their control panel was down (and the server actually went down for an hour), so tried again the following day on the 31st. I kicked off a snapshot in the off chance there was something important on the instance that I needed again in the future. This snapshot didn't finish running before I had to go to work, so I came back in the evening and finished off deleting the instance (well before midnight in Quebec, where this instance was based). The next day, I logged in to find that there was a charge on my November invoice for this instance, so I raised a ticket with their claims department to get the charge cancelled. I got nothing but legalese thrown at me by the claims department, with them saying I needed to cancel the instance 24 hours before, and them later saying actually I needed to cancel by the 19th of the prior month. At the same time, their very own documentation states ""You will need to delete this instance before 00:00 on the 1st day of the following month, so that your monthly subscription is not renewed for this instance."" I pointed this out to them but they were completely unwilling to work with me on this. To add insult to injury, the snapshot I had kicked off failed due to a bug on their end (which their support confirmed in a separate ticket). However, I later found that they were still charging me for the storage used by the failed snapshot, which didn't even contain any usable data. After almost a month of back and forth, they finally gave in and agreed to cancel the charges. At this point I asked for my account to be closed completely which they did. In the end, the resolution was satisfactory, but the process put me off from ever using OVH again. This is in no small part because even after closing the issue, they still asserted that they did nothing wrong. I can only conclude from this experience they don't care that their documentation is misleading (they still haven't fixed it) or that they were charging me for a failed snapshot. They obviously don't want to keep me as a customer, so they won't. There are plenty of other companies in the space who offer competent customer support."
RS,BE,"Dec 26, 2024",4,After 4-5 years of use ! Worth it.,"Have been with OVH for 4-5 years now, once you have found out your way and what you need to do , it is a very good to use. Majority of team is always helpful,I have expereince with Sales, Technical , invoicing, they really go out of their way to help, I have mostly dealt with European teams in Portugal,Spain, France, they are all very supportive. 2 key things of improvement : - documentation surely needs loads of updating, I have myself found 2-3 errors on occasions and lost sometime because of that. - Only disappoint is sometimes they provide high discounts on special occasions so you have to really time your purchase, otherwise you might end up paying 30- 40% more for same thing."

For the first time, I had to use OVH because the .mobi for the domain can only be managed from a few registrar. GoDaddy's price was simply ridiculous. So, I followed the instructions on how to transfer a domain to OVH (like I have done a lot with my regular registrar). Because ""privacy"" was not deactivated with the old registrar, I got an email saying that the operation was cancelled. Fine, I'll correct the situation on my side and restart the process for the transfer. Via Chat, no response, no way to restart the process. Finally got an answer the next day that they weren't not able to restart the process because they already paid the old registar. As per the answer, I had to restart the process and pay for the transfer again. Since the service was not rendered, I asked for the refund but, again, I was told they could not because the service was already paid to the other registrar. With my regular registrar, when something like this happens, I just ask them to restart the process via Chat and, bam, it's done. But OVH, apparently works by other rules than normal companies. Very poor support, information is hard to find on their website and, apparently, they like to charge people for services that they don't deliver !!! Update 25-01-07 : waiting for your answer.

Yet somehow, they still charged me because I forgot to delete the project—even though it was completely empty and used no resources. How does that even make sense? A cloud service is supposed to charge you for what you use. I was using nothing, and they still billed me! On top of that, their support is painfully slow—I waited more than a week for a response, only to be told there would be no refund. To make it worse, they closed my support ticket without even giving me a chance to respond. Avoid them at all cost to save your time and money."

Anonymous,CA,"Updated Nov 21, 2024",1,Freshly purchased a simple web hosting…,"Freshly purchased a simple web hosting plan. 24h after deployment I realize the IP of the server where my one page website was hosted had been blacklisted everywhere. Customer service are simply unable to understand that they should be monitoring server IPs and that they should not deploy server (even shared ones) on these IPs. Not only that, but after going back and forth for 4 days, no one at OVH seemed to want to address the issue. All the agent wanted from me was to jump on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or a dedicated server. To host a simple HTML form. 1 page. Seriously. The cherry on top was that all web hosting plans force you to buy a free domain (even if you already have one with them...) and after 7 days, I am only offered a partial refund. There dedicated servers may be fine for some folks. But don't trust their cloud offering much less their capabilities at maintaining their IPs. 100% would not recommend. If OVH wants to gain a better reputation, they need to admit their faults, monitor their IPs, and just care even just a little about their customer. And don't tell someone you can't change an IP, or migrate a service/server to a different one. When all you have to do is unrack that stainless steel plate, walk to a different rack and rack it. Then mark the IP as blacklisted, and don't rack any server in that slot until the IP is unlisted. EDIT: The fact that it is a shared service does not justify the blacklisted IP. OVH on shared services should be using multiple IPs to circumvent the potential blacklisting. Same services multiples IP. That way you can easily change the blacklisted IPs while you are trying to resolve the issues. Therefore, your customers would not be experiencing the issues I have been. Maybe OVH should rethink their shared infrastructure. At the end of the day, on day 1 I experienced the issue. How do you think I can perceive OVH's capacity to provide such services. When OVH won't even take the most obvious approach to this issue. OVH needs to maintain their IPs. Finally in regards to the full refund. The Consumer Protection Act protected my client in this particular case. By not making the skip button obvious (putting it in a odd place and with a much different style then any other buttons in the interface to make sure it is not seen) you are forcing consumers into free offers which even if they are personalized item, remain free. Thus you cannot claim a value on the item. OVH was completely off the Consumer Protection Act and that is why OVH finally decided to refund the total paid. Not because it is an exceptional service. Also, the fact that if I want to move a purchase domain, I have to register it a second time, makes it an unpersonalized item. Since I need to repurchase it all over. You are trying to shift the blame here to protect OVH's interest. Instead of acknowledging OVH's faults and trying to find solutions. That is the core problem with OVH. Accountability."

Leeroy,GB,"Nov 2, 2024",1,Avoid This Company – No Service Provided and No Customer Support,"I recently purchased 7 VPS servers from OVH, and it has been a frustrating experience from start to finish. Despite paying in full, I never received the service I was promised. Some orders were fulfilled, then removed completely after I had set them up for my clients. Others, they simply were not delivered and the money was withheld and kept by OVH. I've reached out multiple times via email and phone - each time they say they will get back to me and never hear back. All recent messages have been completely ignored, despite even contacting key managers & execs within the company. This lack of communication and failure to deliver the service is deeply unprofessional, and I feel that I’ve been misled. I've given them ample time to respond and rectify the situation, yet they've failed to do so. I’m now in the process of reporting this issue to Action Fraud and their payment processor. I would advise others to think twice before trusting this company with your money. Save yourself the hassle and choose a company that respects its customers and fulfils its promises."

After posting the above review, I received a response with request for more information about my experience from OVHCloud. The response was automated and made no mention of any of my actual issues. I don't get it. Why come to review sites with a bot to send automated messages trying to convince reviewers that they care? They literally cannot even be bothered to read. Let me make this perfectly clear. Do NOT put a live-chat support on your website WITH NO ONE MANNING THE CHAT. Do NOT put a support phone number on your website WITH NO ONE ANSWERING THE PHONE. Do NOT force new customers into 2-factor authorization WHERE NONE OF THE OPTIONS WORK WITHOUT BUGS. Guys, this is simple business. Do not come here to review sites and pretend to care about your customers when you spend zero effort in actually taking care of your new customers nor do you even bother to actually read our reviews!

I tried contacting someone via Live Chat, where a ticket was opened to expedite the verification process. However, no one responded to the ticket. After more than two days, my order was canceled with the following reasons: Your personal information is inaccurate or needs to be updated, which goes against Article 2.1 of our General Terms and Conditions of Service, which you agreed to; You need to update the payment methods saved to your customer account; We are currently verifying your account as set out in Article 2.2 of our General Terms and Conditions of Service, which you agreed to. How they came to this conclusion, I have no idea. Perhaps it was because I paid with my friend’s PayPal account? But that’s not all. The funds are now locked in my PayPal account for 29 days as an ""Authorization"". They rejected the order, but they won’t cancel the PayPal payment authorization. I contacted them again through Live Chat to request that they cancel the PayPal authorization, but instead, they basically treated me with disrespect and closed the chat with the following response: ""Unfortunately, this length of time is beyond our control as it is the standard credit card or PayPal process. Once the pre-authorization has expired, the money will be returned to your account. Thank you for understanding."" This whole experience has been extremely frustrating and unprofessional.

This is something contradicts their offering in the first at the time of purchase as my decison making was based on the turn around, if i knew it will take 15 days i would have gone somehwere else. on top of all this, they wont refund me because the server has to be up and running before they cancel. so now they are holding me hostage i cannot move forward and i paid setup fees as well as first month in advance, so for the next 15 days they can make money from interest accrued and i am screwed with my client. they say the cannot offer me solution, i find it very strange that a big corp like this cannot even offer me a slightly better specs but ready immediately even if they offered it with additonal money at least i am not stuck. this is the second time i purchase from them, first time went well but second one didnt, if this was after the 10th time i would have understood but for an issue to come up like this so quick, it measn they are unreliable and try to make money of many customers who are holding them for 15 days with you hands tied behind your back. bad customer service, poor management and completely unprofessional. i have saved all chats no can can responds otherwise. again no solution offerred but waiting indefinitely, they do not even know when the server will be up and running."

At least their online chat is swift and there are actual agents willing to help but it looks like they can't do anything. The user dashboard/control panel is extremely slow, works only every other time. You also have to login carefully because they have the login system specific to a region. Had you chosen the wrong region, you'll never be able to login (wrong email or password). That makes zero sense. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Addressing a ""reply"": > In the case of an order cancelation, this can have several reasons, such as a lack of information on the account or a payment method that does not make the transaction secure, etc. 1. You could use a spell checker, it's ""cancellation"" in all English dialects. 2. I provided all the required information including my postal address. I did not provide my phone number because not a single support agent told me it was a requirement. And you never asked me to provide the number in any of your emails. 3. How come my debit card is ""insecure""? What is this baloney? Continue to destroy your reputation by posting generic replies without addressing your customers' issues. > In order to be able to analyze the eu exchange with our support and the order concerned, I invite you to respond to our request for information. I haven't received any follow-up emails from you. But I have received your prompt cancellation emails from someone ""verifying"" orders. Must be my non-English name that set them off. So be it. > In addition, in response to this request, can you provide me with your OVHcloud NIC handle in the form abXXX-ovh, or your customer code XXXX-XXXX-XX. Dear LaiM, I've provided TWO order numbers which UNIQUELY identify me. Please look it up. I'm _not_ doing your job. Lastly, your login system is outright BROKEN!!! I cannot login because my IP address is from the UK but I'm a global customer: ""Error: Invalid Account ID or password"". This has been an issue for months if not years. How your customers are putting up with this amount of negligence, semi-broken very slow user control panel (for instance there's a three year old notification you cannot dismiss) and login system bugginess is beyond me. They must have nerves of steel. -------------------------------------------------- Addressing the second reply: > In general, in order for an order not to be rejected, the customer account and payment method information must be complete and correspond to each other. The second time I ordered, I filled in all the information except my phone number. This was not required. The fact that I did not provide it could not possibly be the reason for the cancellation. If it is, you're losing customers left and right. After my order was declined for ""unspecified"" reasons, and no, banks have NEVER done this to me, I deleted my personal information and asked the agent to delete my profile as well. You must have a complete log of every order placed with your company. You must be able to see what information my order contained and why exactly it was rejected. We're in public space right now and I have zero desire to reveal my real name, just as you're just some ""Liam"". Why you insist that I publicly reveal my information is simply outrageous, offensive and concerning. I have yet to receive a single email from you even though you know exactly what my email address is. A few hours ago I filled in a special form on Trustpilot, giving my email address and real name. You must have received them. My email address has never changed. If you want me to place an order a third time, please let me know. Only this time around you will take care of it personally. Also, you must know why my second order was declined. If you never let me know what exactly it was, that's the end of it. No, you're a not a banking organization, you're a hosting provider. And then banking organizations are transparent, unlike you. They have laws and regulations. You seem to have neither, you just wantonly turn orders down."

However, when I added the credit card and activated the project, it reported error 906. And they informed me that I was banned from using their Pubic cloud service.

The plans are not described adequately, and they keep pushing you to upgrade! I initially bought a basic hosting plan. They claimed you could add domains, but when I tried to add one, I was told that the panel had too many domains and that I had to delete some. When I tried to delete them, guess what? They told me I needed to upgrade my plan to delete domains. I contacted support to ask if upgrading would solve all these issues. Let me tell you, their support is incredibly vague and does not explain anything clearly! I upgraded my plan. Now, when I tried to upload my backup files, there’s a size limit of 5MB to 10MB, and extracting large files is not allowed. Compared to other file managers, this one is absolutely terrible (they use net2ftp, and they say you need to talk to an admin to increase the file size limit). When I contacted support again, they said they don’t provide support for this issue unless I upgrade my plan again. Ridiculous. I have never seen a company as greedy and deceptive as this! I’m not asking for special support, just to remove the file size limit, which is something they should do as part of their service. They also refuse to give refunds.

I'm really pissed off!!! I will never order from them again in my life. They're wasting my time and money because the refund period is between 9 days and 26 days. Needless to say, I have better things to do than wait for my money to have to work! SCAM!!! DON'T BUY FROM THEM!!!"

I'll elaborate. Some bulk update features in their interface are broken. I sent them a simple request to either fix that, or do the bulk update for me. Of course I receive a how to guide on how to use the broken feature in the interface. I tell them that I followed those steps, but the tool is simply giving me a server error. They close the ticket. I reopen saying not to send me the same reply. They send me the same reply and close the ticket. I reopen saying that the problem is with their interface. They cancel my one of my services (out of 550+ that I needed to update) and close the ticket. Would highly recommend to stay away from this company, it's terrible. I'm moving everything out."
Tom,GB,"Aug 4, 2024",2,Frustrating payment issues and poor customer service,"I've used OVH Cloud before with good results, but my latest experience has been very disappointing. I attempted to purchase a new VPS, and the payment was taken from my bank account. However, OVH's system didn't register the payment, leaving me without the VPS I paid for. When I contacted customer support, the agent was unwilling to investigate thoroughly or believe my account of events. They insisted on a PDF receipt that my bank doesn't provide and suggested I was lying. Their inability to verify their own financial transactions and the dismissive attitude towards customers is concerning. While I've had good experiences with OVH in the past, I now will be moving my VPS setup elsewhere. I hope they improve their payment systems and train their support staff to be more, well, supportive."

IGNORE the groaning groaners, who think they'll get the world for pennies.","I've been a professional design engineer working in electronics for well over 50 years - yes 50. And I've been in computing & IT just as long, I've used various cloud and hosting companies down 30+ years: OVHCloud offer THE MOST STARTLINGLY GOOD VALUE SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN. Quite Staggeringly, I have a research VPS which I'm using internationally, which costs me the ENORMOUS SUM of £2.16 - yes two pounds sixteen pence sterling.... each month. TOTAL. AND it runs Debian smoothly with a virtual desktop and does all I want of it. All of us who work in cloud, know there are reams of companies out there who can do this - but it's very easy to spend £10/20 a month for one VPS. To be able to rent working servers - with 20GB disc space - for well under £3 -- is a MARVEL -- THANK YOU OVH, I am impressed and I recommend you widely. There are other companies out there that offer marvellous service - but they all have their strengths and particular focusses, there are things they don't do and things they do very well. And there are a few who do nothing well (you know who you are 1and1). So - find who's best for what, by experiment and by looking here. Now I'll break all the Trustpilot rules and give a quick separate shout out to -- UK2.net, the BEST WEBHOST in Britain by a country mile, for your fine service down 25 years, Back to OVH - their plan - unashamedly - is to offer superb pricing, for baseline services, delivered cleanly to people who can self-manage largely. If you need reams of help & support, maybe go to Digital Ocean, but be prepared to pay 4X - 5X as much. Many ""grumblers"" who write the ""1 star"" reviews here seem to be non-professionals, who don't grasp what's what (eg a tearful ""....but they didn't back up all my data for free..."" - when OVH never said they would, you can purchase backup options - pretty plain to my eye ).

Leur équipe, notamment Fernando V., a fait preuve d'un manque de professionnalisme scandaleux en insinuant que j'avais mal passé ma commande. Ils n'ont même pas pris la peine de vérifier correctement les détails de ma commande avant de répondre de manière inutile et désinvolte. Le problème n'est pas le nom de domaine gratuit, mais l'attitude du service client. Fernando V. m'a répondu avec une phrase irrespectueuse : ""Vous aurez du regarder la commande avant de payer."" Cela fait maintenant trois jours que je n'ai pas accès à mon nom de domaine, ce qui démontre leur incompétence. Ce manque de sérieux me fait perdre un temps précieux pour un montant dérisoire de 9,99 $. Maintenant, je comprends pourquoi cette entreprise a une note aussi lamentable de 2 sur Trustpilot Canada.

They didn't even bother to properly check the details of my order before responding in a useless and cavalier manner. The issue is not the free domain name but the attitude of the customer service. Fernando V. responded to me with a disrespectful phrase: ""You should have checked the order before paying."" It has now been three days without access to my domain name, which demonstrates their incompetence. This lack of seriousness is wasting my precious time for a paltry amount of $9.99.

deferred_impact,UA,"Updated Aug 3, 2024",1,"Locked my account, stole $50 with no explanation","Horrible. Utterly horrible. EDIT: It's even worse. See further down. A few days ago (Friday i think it was) i ordered a dedicated server from OVHCloud to host my multiplayer game. The server was great! Superb performance and straightforward setup. Cost me $50 ($25 setup and $25 first month). Then Saturday morning i wake up and find out i can't log into OVHCloud, and my game is unplayable as the server is dead. What the hell? OVH offered no explanation (beyond a bunch of generic ""your service has been terminated"" messages in my email). I had no choice but to create a new account, as i need an account to open a ticket, to complain about this. But of course since it is Saturday, nobody cared. Finally on Monday i got a response on my ticket... ""we cannot address your issue as it is related to a different account."" What the absolute f... I can't open a ticket on my actual account because you locked it! They suggested i email (abuse at their site dot net) instead. So i did. Thankfully, that helped... no it f...ing didn't. It's been 24 hours since i sent my email and no response! They suggested i call their support number. First of all, why the absolute hell do i need to call when you already have a proper support ticket system? What is the point of a support ticket system then? But fine, i thought, i'll call. And... the number doesn't connect! What is going on with your company? This isn't about the $50. This isn't about the server. This isn't about the time i wasted setting stuff up on your platform. This isn't even about the (so far) 4 days of not having a proper server (thank gods i still have my old server running, so i just pointed the DNS back to it and we could still play the game, albeit with worse performance). No. This is about the attitude. This kind of customer ""support"" is atrocious and utterly unacceptable. Why completely lock an account? Why give zero explanation for locking it? Why redirect me from your ticketing system towards your email and phone? Why treat me like i'm your enemy, when i'm just trying to pay you money and get a basic level of service in return??? At this point all i care about is getting back my $50. I will never once touch OVHCloud again. EDIT: I just finally tried to call their support phone number, cuz it's apparently ""not connected"" most of the time and you have to call it during specific hours. So i finally had the opportunity to call. Guess what?! Every single option is ""this option is currently not available""! This is ridiculous. Literal scam. EDIT2: and now they are asking me, under this review as you can clearly see, to provide an account ID. That i can only fetch by logging in. When i am literally complaining about them LOCKING MY ACCOUNT to the point that i CANNOT LOG IN. Wow. This level of trolling is honestly impressive. Well done! Why the f... do you need my account ID?? You KNOW MY EMAIL ADDRESS EDIT3: I suspected a security issue was the cause of account termination. That is fine. The issues are: - it has never been explained to me what conditions i breached. I merely hosted my multiplayer game on your server and uploaded my binaries to your S3 buckets as a way to quickly transfer them to the server. How is this against ToS?? - support quality has been atrocious. Terminating a ""malicious"" account is perfectly fine, but cutting off all communication is unacceptable. What if the termination was not, in fact, correct? What if your automated system misidentified my perfectly valid use of your services as malicious? I still believe i never misused your service, and deserve a refund. *If* you actually contacted me and provided details on which ToS points i violated and how, perhaps i would take back my complaints."

Mir Mosheraf,CH,"Jul 11, 2024",1,Extremely Disappointing Service and Support from OVH Clouditle,"I am compelled to share my extremely disappointing experience with OVH Cloud for the second time. As a business owner, my reliance on consistent and reliable server access is crucial. Unfortunately, OVH Cloud has failed me at a critical time, risking my business operations and potential financial loss. Recently, after a server reboot by OVH, I was unable to access my server for remote desktop connections. Log in server had been functioning without issues until this incident . Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue myself, I was left unable to access my server from 7/7/2024. Adding to my frustration, I reached out to OVH Cloud support immediately, highlighting the urgency due to the impact on my business. However, their response has been unacceptably slow. It's been a significant amount of time, and I have yet to receive a meaningful solution or even an acknowledgment of my issue. This lack of timely support is utterly unacceptable for a service that claims to cater to business needs. The potential financial impact due to this downtime is severe, and OVH Cloud's inability to provide prompt assistance has left me incredibly dissatisfied. As a paying customer, I expected better service and support from OVH Cloud. Their failure to address this issue swiftly and efficiently has resulted in a significant disruption to my business operations. I am deeply disappointed and would not recommend OVH Cloud to anyone relying on stable and responsive server solutions. OVH Cloud, you need to significantly improve your support services and ensure that your customers' issues are addressed promptly, especially when their businesses are at stake."

William,GB,"Updated Jun 22, 2024",1,Support/billing is awful,I've used OVH and before then SYS for many years but now I would find it hard to recommend them. There support for billing issues is horrendous as you can't create tickets for pricing issues you have to contact sales not via a ticket and you only get 300 characters to explain your issue instead of using the ticket system like everyone else I would only ever recommend OVH servers if they are on a mega deal unless you are going to sit in contract while people pay lower than you and when you get out of contract they refuse to readjust the price of the server to what they current advertise. There pricing is cheap but it's a slap in the face to have to be paying more than new customers or be paying double than a customer who bought it on a deal. But just to reiterate the breaking point for me was when you refused to readjust my price to the new one after my contract (I was asking to match with the without commitment price just to be clear) I was told to contact sales not through tickets for some stupid reason only to have a ticket created and be answered by the same person who told me to contact sales. The reason this isn't 1 star is I've had no problems with the hardware or networking however the main thing when it comes down to is cost and to pay double what new customers and to be told to reorder my server instead of reducing my prices is unacceptable for a company of this size If you could help it would look elsewhere **Update do not give them credit for asking for more information nothing has been done and I have not been contacted

A Fakhro,BH,"Updated May 19, 2024",1,WORST SERVER COMPANY,"UPDATE: One week has elapsed. The server is still down. Nothing has been done. The amazing aspect of their billing system is that on the my services page, 'Server' status shows 'Bill to Pay' (which means Due Now). When we click on 'View Service Details', it opens the 'Licences - Windows' page and shows 'Renewal due on 30 Nov 2024'. They actually asked me to pay this amount until I highlighted this internal billing error. After this, OVH has reiterated the fact that there is 'NO' technical issue and it is in fact an internal 'billing error'. These are their own words below: ""After further analysis, it seems like it is indeed an internal problem related to the Billing system. Since you are currently communicating with the Cloud technical team and we have very low impact/accesses on the Billing aspect. In that case, it would be better to discuss with the Billing team for that matter."" Pay careful attention to their response above. They are trying to portray that the technical team and billing team have no access or communication with each other. I understand that they are separate departments but from the same company. Instead of asking me to deal with the billing department, shouldn't they deal with each other internally and fix the matter? After almost a week, they have the time to send me a response and ask me to deal with their billing team instead of reactivating the server by any and all means possible. Questions: If there is no technical error, why is the server still down? If it is an internal billing error, why can't they rectify it and activate the server? Why is all this takings weeks? Who will compensate the business loss associated with this server outage? Again, I fail to understand one basic concept. Are not the cloud technical team and the billing team from the same company? Can't they coordinate with each other and fix the problem? When you order a dish at a restaurant, they are supposed to serve you the dish; Not inform you about the ingredients and how to prepare the dish. Even there is a problem with the dish, they fix it! Not tell you how they will fix it or ask you to do it yourself! I AM PAYING FOR A SERVICE AND I NEED THE SERVICE TO BE ACTIVE. ABSOLUTE DISASTER AND FAILURE.

GOODBYE DEAR SERVER; ""Reposez en paix"" ________________________________________________ This is by far the WORST customer service and the WORST technical support. Their support is non-existent. Here are the details of this operation: Server check Date 2024-05-14 11:14:32 BST (UTC +01:00), Server check: Server hardware checked and no issues found. Issue seems to be due to billing robot not updating the server's state. This is the message we received. For two days, the server is still down. They have clearly stated that the server hardware is intact. Issue is clearly caused by their billing robot. Multiple Live Chats and service tickets later, its been over 48 hours. From what I have read here, I am one of the lucky ones. With no technical issue present, why has it taken them this long to reactivate the server, especially when the fault is theirs? Will they reimburse the losses? They also had the audacity to inform me to moderate my attitude. In line with most of the comments in this site regrading OVH's service, I also reiterate the fact that one must Give Respect and Take Respect! If you were in our place, facing losses due to server outage, and sending multiple service requests and conducting live chats without any result, your attitude would be far worse. Put yourself in the customer's shoes. From what we have seen on this site, we are not alone in this mess. It seems like you have tortured enough and more people with your extremely poor service. I already informed my business associates, who I recommended to start using OVH. I sent the transcript of my Live Chat to all 152 associates and convinced them to cancel their subscriptions. They all cursed me for pushing them to change to OVH. A server company, in this modern era of AI, cannot keep giving crap excuses and keep cheating loyal customers. One good thing is that their Billing Robot NEVER has any technical issues when it comes to deducting our charges monthly. I would request your inefficient team to assign this Robot to deal with all their customer issues. It is better than human beings, with robot like attitude and no power or knowledge to resolve any issues."
Paillat,CH,"Updated May 18, 2024",1,Ovhcloud is trying to bill me 147 Euros for nothing,"Ovhcloud is trying to bill me 147 Euros for a service they never provided. The reneval payment with my credit card did not come trough, because the credit card expired. I noticed it, and switched provider, because I did not want to stay with OVH anymore anyways. I also cancelled the service from their UI. BUT they thought that it was logical to bill me anyways. I do not recommend ovhcloud, their dashboard is also ugly and buggy, and support inexistent. EDIT 1: I did reply to the request, but could not see this reply first. I added a ticket number for a ticket I opened on this matter. EDIT 2: OvhCLOUD replied to my ticket without even bothering to read it, with just a tutorial on how to pay my bill. Apart from this being completely disrespectful, I still do not, see why I would have to pay a bill on a service ovhcloud themselves deleted and aknowledged having done so."

Update 15/5/2024 Got an email fro support, mentioning a domain transfer timing that is completely different than the one mentioned before, and about three times slower than the worldwide standard. In addition, they had the arrogance to point me on the respectfulness of my mail: let me be clear: if you treat your customers without any respect over and over again, do not ask for respect.

Several lost CPanel accounts from my clients, source codes, database, emails. They defend themselves by saying that it was my fault for not paying for the backup package, not paying for premium support and that now it's over, that they are only ""machine suppliers"" and are not responsible for any system corruption issues. Before I went to sleep everything was running, I woke up with everything inaccessible and corrupted.

Akash Roy,IN,"Apr 22, 2024",1,Disappointing Experience with OVHcloud's Domain Purchase,"I encountered a frustrating bait-and-switch pricing tactic at OVHcloud. Their .in domain initially advertised for just 99 rupees, ballooned to 724 rupees at checkout. Adding to the frustration, my first purchase attempt was halted by an ""internal issue,"" and the unpaid invoice then mysteriously vanished. This lack of transparency and reliability in pricing and technical performance from a known cloud services provider is unacceptable. Buyers, beware of hidden fees and unstable purchasing processes at OVHcloud."

Any way I couldn't login so via the paypal email asked they refund me they refused, Went to paypal and pp also refused to give my money, I would recommend ppl using a credit card as you are covered. For some reason paypal don't cover you on this under the buyers protection. To date cant access a whole yrs service for 12usd which was for testing reasons. Good job I didn't take all my business over there. I would suggest people look for cloud computing which with support before and after you become a customer and a refund policy. If they don't have any avoid like OVH. It is also French company. Are u a joke would u like me to copy and paste the conversation on PayPal message boards??? This is why ur a bad company u ignore ppl. U don't know who says what. U customer reps are all freelancers and don't help. U might be a direct rep who knows nothing of what is happening in ur own business. My argument has been validated. Disgraceful company. How are u even still trading."

This is why I'm upgrading one star to 2 stars. Before: I wanted to buy a ccTLDs domain through OVHcloud. And I bought it. But even though I waited for a day, they could not transfer the domain. For a whole day! What happened next? Someone else bought it. I opened a ticket and it's been a day and they haven't back. I hope they refund the fee I paid for the domain. But paying the fee means nothing to me from now on. I will not use OVHcloud in any way. I do not recommend you to use it, especially when registering a domain!"

Daniel,IT,"Updated Apr 4, 2024",3,"The server is broken, but they deny the evidence.","I've been a customer for a long time and have significant experience managing servers. I'm not a novice when it comes to dedicated servers. I purchased a new server with an annual contract in November 2023. On December 26, 2023, we experienced a malfunction and subsequently had the server replaced. They provided a spare server, which they claimed had been recently tested. Since then, we've been experiencing frequent system freezes, occurring randomly every 3 to 20 days. We've encountered at least 6 freezes. Each time, the system freezes with the keyboard becoming unresponsive. During this period, my technical team thoroughly analyzed the operating system and the configuration of all installed software. We found no anomalies in the various logs analyzed. Additionally, we updated the kernel to the latest available version. We also hired an expert from outside the company to identify any possible software-level anomalies, but they found no evidence of software problems. Finally, following OVH's suggestion, we performed diagnostic tests on the server hardware using OVH utility in rescue mode. During the last test, the server crashed while diagnosing the CPU. It's important to note that these tests were conducted in rescue mode, confirming that the issue is not software-related. Given the above, we requested that OVH proceed with the repair or replacement of our server with a new unit as soon as possible. However, OVH's response was that there's no evidence of hardware failure. Despite repeated requests for proof of the hardware's condition, they never provided any evidence. Instead, OVH closed my ticket, accusing me of not wanting to deal with such failures and suggesting I switch to their cloud service, which costs three times as much. Furthermore, they closed the ticket in a manner that prevents me from reopening it to continue the discussion. This behavior is unacceptable for customer service. It's more like customer disservice. I would purchase a new server myself to replace the faulty one, but I'm bound by the terms of my annual contract. Before considering OVH's dedicated server service, I urge you to think not once, but ten times. If your server turns out to be faulty, they'll deny responsibility and stop communicating with you altogether. EDIT 07-03-2024 They requested my OVH details that I promptly provided, but nobody contacted me for a solution. UPDATE A server freezes multiple times with black screen and keyboard not responding and they responded that ""no problem affect the performance"". Performance is not an issue. The issue is that this server get stuck with keyboard not responding and black screen, therefore the off topic reply here is a proof of the poor service that I'm receiving. If they're technician are unable to find the problem it doesn't give them the right to deny the problem. Why should I accept apologize from a company that provide a poor service like that and deny the problem in front of my evidence? As I said I would buy a new server and reinstall from scratch again but I'm linked to an annual contract and I'm forced to keep paying for a broken server unless they propose a real solution like to enable me to transfer the annual contract to a new server What I can say. Stay away. EDIT 04/04/2024 After the bad review and few more complaints they offered me the solution to replace the server, however they moved the old disks to the new server and for me it isn't as replace the whole server. However how everything is working from more then 20 days without problem. I can't give 5 stars but only 3 instead of 1 because you provided me a solution only after have read the bad review and many other complaints on my side."

When I opened a different ticket and asked them to deal with the related support request, they closed the new ticket we opened by saying that we are already dealing with you. This is actually tantamount to insulting the customer. There is no solution to the problem for such a long time. And even though the problem is not solved, they respond as if they are mocking you. It is not possible to understand what kind of attitude this is. I have been an OVH customer for years. But I guess OVH does not want us as customers. There can be no other interpretation of this.

jc,GB,"Updated Feb 29, 2024",1,"OVH and my stolen domain, don't trust them.","How ovh got to be so big is beyond me, it is seriously one of the most incompetent most awful company ever in the UK, every time I think it can't get any worse, then they go and surprise me, a few years ago I had a domain I was hosting with ovh that I spent lots of money on to promote and build up, this domain was stolen, it could only have been with inside help from ovh, I had over 11000 users at the time, that cost me sweat and blood, lots of sleepless nights. Nobody at ovh took responsibility for it, my ticket was just ignored then closed, in the end I gave up because I was tired and closed to a mental breakdown. Over 3 weeks ago, ovh took over £200 from my account because of their system malfunctioning, it took almost a week for them to respond to my ticket, so I opened a case against ovh on PayPal, but that took days for them to respond. I had to keep posting on twitter to get their attention, I then got a phone call from them with an apology and a promise that the money will be reversed within 5hrs, 4 days later and no money received, I asked on the ticket and on twitter, I got a reply saying I had to close the case against them first, I thought with past experience of ovh, not a good idea, so I phoned up PayPal to asked what to do,PayPal said I was right to contact them and that closing the case before resolution was a bad idea, that they advise against. Also 2 weeks after that I have received 2 emails from ovh asking me to close the case.I spoke to my bank on Tuesday about this, and they said I should follow PayPal advice on this too, but in the meantime they were glad I brought this to their attention. I have a feeling that I am not the only one that ovh has done this to, so I've sent details to my local trading standards, London trading standards, and also to the FCA, I will wait and see what happens with my correspondence with the 2 trading standards and FCA, but in the mean time, anyone with ovh issues should contact your local trading standards and also FCA, it's worth the effort, it's the only way that companies like ovh can be forced to do better if they want to trade in UK and in the EU, don't suffer in silence, and don't let ovh get away with it anymore. OVH has blocked me on twitter as of yesterday 23/02/2024, I also received an email yesterday saying one of my domain name with them was going up, registration cost is going up, I doubt if it's a coincidence. One of ovh support team member on twitter says it's nothing to do with him, some support! What is he or her answering support requests for? There should be a NO STAR option on trustpilot. And someone or people should gather all the other ovh previously reviews under their multiple previous names and put them together, I found 3 on trustpilot for ovh uk alone, all with crap reviews about ovh going back years and years, a leopard cannot change it's spots. Any OVH response to say they are sorry and that this is not their way is total lies. -------------------------------------------- in response to vinl at ovh reponse of duplicate refund, paypal says there is no reason for ovh not refunding me, because refunding me will automatically bring the case to a close, i know who i believe on this, ovh has been nothing but lies after lies, ovh went even feather to try and get my feedback here removed, everything i said in the review is all true, it happened as i wrote, my domain was stolen, ovh support ignored me a closed the case without help. ovh system malfunctioned and ovh double charged me over £200, i opened a ticket immediately a month ago now, ovh hasn't refunded. i have responded days ago to ovh ticket telling them i rather believe what my bank and paypal tell me about not closing the case at paypal. so ovhcloud, tell me what part you disagree with so everyone can know why you are trying to get the feedback i left with you on here removed? let everyone know, i've got a screenshot of this and other thing to take to my MP. i am also prepared to go to court to back up what i have said so far, there is a lot i have left out because of trustpilot rules, but i can and will reveal more if trading standards ask when they get back to me."
Victor Pol,GB,"Feb 20, 2024",1,OVHcloud: A Disastrous Experience from Start to Finis,"I cannot stress enough how utterly disappointing my experience with OVHcloud has been. From start to finish, their service has been an absolute nightmare, leaving me with nothing but frustration and regret. Let's start with the technical aspect. The virtual server they provided me with was a complete joke. Despite their promises of top-notch performance, the server's capacity fell short of their advertised specifications. It was like buying a sports car only to find out it runs like a beaten-up old jalopy. My team and I struggled to meet even our basic needs on this subpar hardware. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. When I attempted to address these issues with their support team, I was met with nothing but incompetence and indifference. Instead of addressing my concerns, they seemed more interested in passing the buck and shirking responsibility. It's as if they have a handbook on how to avoid providing any real assistance to their customers. And let's not forget their refund policy, or should I say, lack thereof. Despite my clear dissatisfaction and requests for a refund, they flat out refused, hiding behind some obscure company policy that conveniently absolves them of any responsibility. It's clear that OVHcloud cares more about lining their pockets than actually providing value to their customers. In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and reputable cloud service provider, look elsewhere. OVHcloud is a prime example of everything that's wrong with the industry – deceptive advertising, abysmal customer service, and a complete disregard for customer satisfaction.

Exhausted,FR,"Updated Feb 21, 2024",1,Everything goes wrong,"Everything goes wrong, they let you renew for the next year instead of the actual year and cancel your domain saying you didn't pay for the good year (why would I pay for next year if I don't pay for this one!!??), they FORCE you to pay for domains you don't want anymore (because you are in automatic renewal and it needs to be paid with the domain you want to keep), they give you a free domain with an hosting plan but you are stuck with this domain forever. They keep domains in your account but you cannot renew them because they don't support the tld anymore.. The support barely answer you if you open tickets, prefer the live chat, only thing working there (and maybe I got lucky with one good support person). One word to describe my experience: RUN Update 1: I got lucky with the live support person, the second one was horrible and asked me about my previous tickets instead of fixing my new problem. The links in the emails they send to me redirect to the canadian version of OVH and my credentials are not working on this version of the website. I explained this and they asked me to send a screenshot of the error but BE READY, they only accept PDF versions of the image and the support interface doesn't have a field to upload a file so you have 2 options: first one is to upload the PDF on a tool called plik (you have to read a manual to use it) that looks like a tool from the beginning of internet but you need to authenticate to use it and.. guess what? my account cannot connect because i'm again getting redirected when I try to login. So that leaves me with the second option which is to answer to the email ticket opened by the live chat support for me and to attach a screenshot of the error that I have (which is basically only ""Wrong Credentials"") that I had to convert from PNG to PDF before inserting it to the email. again WELL DONE OVH Update 2: They tried to make my review disappear saying it was not legit.. I sent an email to Trustpilot to prove it was, that's how they fix the problems at OVH"
Abdulrehman Sandhu,GB,"Updated Feb 15, 2024",1,Avoid OVHCloud - Worst Hosting Company,"I represent a web development company in London, and I purchased a VPS from OVHCloud on 3rd February 2024 because they provided Cpanel Hosting. However, my current hosting company only uses Plesk, and I wanted to migrate to Cpanel. My server was activated on 4th of February 2024, and I successfully migrated to the new server on 10th of February, subsequently closing my Plesk server. Unfortunately, on 11th of February, my server went down unexpectedly, and despite my repeated attempts to contact OVHCloud, I have been unable to reach their technical support team as they only operate during regular business hours, from 9 AM to 5 PM. After two days of persistent follow-up, I finally received an email informing me that my account has been closed for security reasons, resulting in the deletion of all 87 client websites hosted on their platform. Shockingly, they did not provide any prior explanation or warning regarding this drastic action. Although I am fortunate to have backups of the websites, the process of restoring 87 websites is incredibly labor-intensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, my clients have been understandably frustrated and impatient for the past two days. To compound matters, I have yet to receive any refund from OVHCloud, despite being charged the full hosting fees for the two days of service that I was able to use. This situation has been extremely disruptive to my business operations and has caused significant inconvenience to both myself and my clients. I urge OVHCloud to provide a swift resolution, including a refund for the unused portion of my hosting fees, and to implement better communication practices to avoid similar issues in the future. **In response to your reply:** I run a software house. In the event of any issue with the software, you should have suspended the service and promptly informed me about the problem. I paid £90 for one week of service, and if this issue was not addressed, I request a refund. If necessary, I will escalate this matter to multiple platforms."

DelanoAu,AU,"Feb 8, 2024",1,Poor & unreliable customer service - get everything in email from support,"I decided to switch to OVHCloud VPS on the basis that they could allow 2 networked sessions on the Hypervisor to reduce database latency. So I subscribed, but tech support in France very quickly told me it could not be done. They apologised, cancelled the service and said they would process a full refund. Except that a month later, I still had not received my refund. I then called Customer Support in Australia. No record of the conversation, the account was only deleted after the end of the month, so no refund. No attempt to read the tech logs, voice recording etc. Just No Refund. Their final ""proposed solution"" - saying sorry, but no refund! Really just shocking customer service. My advice, hound the tech guy to send you a notice the cancellation notice and email you the promise of a full refund. Or you can kiss your refund goodbye! [CS9257977] [CS9043648]"

Maksym,UA,"Jan 27, 2024",3,"Not great, but not too bad","A rather problematic provider in terms of positioning DDoS protection. They clearly allocate to dedicated servers an overselled network. But in any case, the servers are quite stable and the ping is acceptable. Sometimes there are unknown problems with ping and it's 100% on the side of OVH. Support is quite slow. Good documentation, flexible configuration of the dedicated server are obvious pluses for me. But it would be good to finally move to the standard of minimal 1Gbit network at all dedicated servers, as for me in the field of dedicated servers it should happen long time ago! And I would be happy to see 10Gbit servers at an adequate price. The firewall is unfortunately disappointing, namely the limit of 20 rules. This is not enough when you really want to secure a large machine, also in the firewall you can not use port ranges for example (8000-8050). DDoS protection is available, but it works strangely. Frequent throttling of pure traffic during a big attack, and you have to wait for a minute and a half for the connection to resume. Also TCP protection is obviously very weak, my router is often attacked, and 200k-350k TCP connections in a couple of seconds does not embarrass the traffic cleaning system of the OVH. At the moment it is a solid three out of five, because of the problems above, and the lack of a competitor."

When I contacted with their support on Facebook I got notified that they cannot help me there and I need to be patience. How the f..k should I be patience if EVERY DAY I am receiving more and more spam e-mails from multiple, disposable, temporary domains? I cannot even block them. OVH support criminal activity, so if you are criminal and like to steal, phishing, scam - OVH services are for you. They won't do anything regardless spam. I cannot upload evidence screen here, so open Imgur service and add this ""/a/gUYem1n"" to url to see my screenshoot with report issues and their answer. ----- edit to answer: You do nothing with past abuse reports and support criminal activity. How long should it take? Few months since every day I receive new e-mails that I cannot block? Spammer still creates new domains and send me fake ""winning iphone/UPS delivery/cashapp"" spams do obtain my data. Your abuse form for phishing not working correctly.

Alex,IE,"Updated Nov 13, 2023",1,Extremely Disappointed with OVH Support – Urgent Need for Improvement,"I've had several interactions with OVH support over the last year, and frankly, my experience has been deeply disappointing. Here’s a detailed account: 1. Exasperatingly Slow Response on a Basic Inquiry: As my 12-month Pro Web Hosting contract was nearing its end, I reached out to OVH support for some basic pricing information and details about their database services. It took them nearly two weeks to respond, which is unacceptable in any business, especially in the fast-paced tech industry. This delay caused significant inconvenience and frustration. 2. Inadequate and Unhelpful Response to a Critical Technical Issue: A more serious issue occurred when I attempted a DNS record change, and it failed to take effect. Expecting prompt and efficient support, I contacted OVH. After a two-day wait, which is a lifetime in web hosting terms, their response was utterly unhelpful - redirecting me to generic online documentation without addressing my specific problem. This lack of direct support and clarification left me in a bind, with an unresolved issue and a feeling of being completely ignored. The level of support provided by OVH has been dismally poor. When dealing with technical services, delays and ineffective responses can lead to serious business implications. It's alarming that OVH seems to be neglecting this crucial aspect of customer service. I am writing this review to highlight the urgency with which OVH needs to revamp its customer support. While their hosting services might be adequate, their support system is severely lacking and has left me frustrated and disappointed. Improvements in this area are not just necessary; they are critical. to Luigi Thanks Luigi, as you mentioned the ticket for technical may be answer in your hours timeframe , but it s the quality that lacking. And again to day, the answer is a link to your documentation, that my request is out of your support. Thanks Luigi, as you mentioned, technical tickets may be answered within your work hours, but the quality is lacking. And again today, the answer is a link to your documentation, indicating that my request is outside of your support scope. Since joining OVH, I have had my fair share of issues. For example, SSL was not set properly, my WordPress site was pointing to both HTTP and HTTPS files, directory listing was enabled, and I couldn't use a free email account because it went straight to the recipient's junk folder. (I was also unable to add a DNS record.) These are basic things that should work straight out of the box, but they simply don't on OVH. Knowing that I cannot count on OVH support, I will deal with the problems myself as I already did for most issue. The irony is that your support team said they can't check the server config for data protection reasons, but at the same time they're telling me to contact your partner, who would obviously be able to help if I pay them enough."
Shihab,BD,"Nov 9, 2023",1,They are big scammer,"I ordered 9 VPS servers, but they cancelled this without any reason. I contacted with them, they told my profile details is not matched with my documents. But I give prove that my all information is correct. Now they tell to reorder the services. But they did not give the refund of 9 VPS. They tell you will get refund in 7-14days. But did not get any refund in 30 days."
Claus DK,DK,"Nov 7, 2023",4,Okay... but...,"I'm generally happy with OVH's... servers. I have been a customer for over 5+ years(much longer). All the way back to SoYouStart(owned by OVH) > OVH. But their support is a bit slow. A simple support ticket takes about 3-25 days.(ticket 8688843 <-- haha ;) ) I pay over 120 euro every month and I pay ~20 euro for IP's. I take care of most things myself..but from time to time have to contact support. I upgraded my server about 2 years ago, but the upgrade process was not quite as expected. I had to pay 1 months extra rent because they would not refund the last of period of my server..because it had crossed 1-2 days over the new month rental period. It would be nice if you could give your current customers a better service and upgrade abilities... even people with 2 year contracts ;). BUT all this said.. I'm pretty happy with them."

Jonathan Mathews,GB,"Oct 19, 2023",1,Waiting one hour to get through to someone on their SALES line...,"They're clearly not that bothered about selling anything... In my case I'm just trying to get through to someone in Billing (obviously they only give out telephone numbers for their Sales team, who don't pick up anyway...) to discuss my contract. I'd like to cancel as I've encountered too many technical issues at this early stage - my server won't boot in normal mode any more, something to do with OS configuration - and there is little direction on how to solve it. I get that there are different tiers of support and you can't get gold standard support without paying for it, but if you're not a tech whiz like me and you have trouble making sense of complex documentation, you're stuffed. For example, none of their support team has been helpful enough to give me a brief idiot's guide on how to check the logs in rescue mode, or if I decide to reinstall the OS, exactly what configuration I should select so that this problem doesn't reoccur. On the positive side, their live chat agents do respond very quickly. I just don't get how they can leave customers hanging on the sales line for so long - do they not want the business... My impression was this would be very much plug and play, but it's been a disaster so far. I can't believe I've been waiting an hour to talk to a human, this is worse than airlines. Share price doesn't provide too much reassurance either..."

Tony Gavin,PH,"Updated Nov 1, 2023",1,Take note of the MANY negative reviews,"I'm highly experienced with servers (close to 20 years). I've had some poor experiences with hosts before, but this is FAR & AWAY the worst. After an entire day of myself and our server admin screwing with their utterly useless instructions, we just gave up trying to deploy the VPS we'd purchased from OVHcloud. We were repeatedly provided with instructions that DO NOT provide you with access to purchased services. Additionally, multiple ""help"" links in support emails lead to 404 error pages. I found support to be unhelpful at best and as useful as a screen door on a submarine at worst. Responses were slow. Questions were overtly stupid. Answers were uninformative and/or outright inaccurate. Their billing system has all the hallmarks of a scam. It is impossible to terminate services via their admin panel, just as it's impossible to delete payment methods or even pause automatic payments from your nominated payment source. This is contrary to what their own support pages state. The ""instructions"" for account cancellation are a work of complete fiction. Buttons to ""pause"" or ""cancel"" are unclickable. I have screenshots. I will be opening a dispute with Visa card tomorrow - no need to wait with this crew. I really don't know if their issue is simple incompetence or outright fraud. Either way, the consequences are the same. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this company. RESPONSE TO OVHCLOUD REPLY As expected, a response that may as well have been from a robot. Take notice of this. It's EXACTLY what you can expect from OVHcloud support; mindless copy/paste responses which fail to address the problem in any way. UPDATE 01 NOVEMBER 2023 Today, my bank issued me with a full refund to my credit card, after I opened a dispute. Once again, beware of this company."
Steph Baxter,BE,"Sep 7, 2023",1,The worst support,"The support offered by OVH is without doubt the worst I have ever encountered. I first opened a ticket on 2nd August on behalf of the charity I work for (ClassContact - we help sick children). OVH responded with a long list of documents to fill in. Our director duly sent ALL of these documents and more and we were astonished to receive a simple email on 7th August saying our request had been refused. On phoning the support desk that same day we were told that they could not contact the procedural team who deal with the matter, nor give us their telephone number. We must just ""wait a few days for their reply"" or contact them via another email. The procedural team subsequently did not reply to this or another email: not even an auto-response. The next day the support ticket was closed, declared as ""resolved""! I phoned the ""support desk"" again, to be told exactly the same story. We must just wait for a response. Here we are a MONTH later still waiting... OVH were super-quick to accept our credentials when it came to taking our money, but then subsequently refuse to allow us access to our own account. Is this even legal? Of course our charity has not the financial resources to challenge this cavalier behaviour by OVH. I detest leaving bad reviews, and do this as a last resort when all else fails. Still hoping for a solution..."

After this incident we had a week+ conversation with support. No sorry, no compensation. Their position that ""it was the scheduled maintenance"" because they had written about it somewhere in their status page that we even hand't known about. If you want to know about their PLANNED maintenances you shoud check their updates by yourself. Btw a half a year ago I tried to learn their prices to set up a few dozens new bare metal hosts.

Asger,DK,"Updated Aug 3, 2023",1,Annoying quotas and slow response times,"I work as a DevOps consultant and have a 5 year+ experience. I was hired to check out OVHcloud, as a client was interested in potentially choosing them as their provider. I can easily tell you, OVHcloud is by far the worst provider I've had the pleasure of working on. The signup process itself is easy enough, but when you're ready to build, you're met with quota after quota, hindering you in deploying even the smallest, cheapest instances. Why are these in place, even after I have filled in payment info. and info. about the company? Not only that, when you write an email to OVHcloud (as that is the only way to increase your quota...), they ask you the exact same questions you answered, last time you asked for an increase, as if they are oblivious to you as a customer. To top that off, their response time is by far the longest in the business. I would love more European cloud providers, as we have to take data sharing seriously, but if OVHcloud is ever going to compete with the big ones, they will need to improve. Here's a hint: Remove annoying quotas and improve your response times. EDIT: OVH Cloud responded after my Trustpilot review and have now allowed me to manage my quotas myself, which is an improvement. You should just set a default quota, so customers are able to try out your services for some time, instead of hindering them completely."

Fast forward 18 hours, server is online, but will disconnect randomly and be entirely unaccessible unless using a KVM which will boot you out after 5 minutes no matter what. Ran a hardware test on the NIC, which came back with several failures. Opened another ticket, still no response. When we finally got a response, they wanted us to run several Linux commands for our Windows Server 2019 to determine some routes to ensure the NIC was bad. Even with us sending the reports from the machine, including reports from RescueMode, they wanted a specific type of report. So we followed their instruction, they did an intervention and just logged into the server later and uninstalled the Ethernet drivers from the Windows Server. We then got a follow up on the ticket telling us that the server was in WinRescue mode for us to connect and fix it, since we ""broke"" it. Somehow, without us being able to access the box for over 72 hours while they were ""working"" on it, it was somehow the clients fault we were unable to connect. BTW, I am a USA customer.

Uptime is as close to 100% as you can get, very rarely have I had any hardware faults. If there is a fault, the intervention and repair is very quick. The control panel is mostly good, it can be a bit clunky but it handles a lot of OVH products. I do wish the firewall settings were easier to manage."

I think that is their attempt to take my money without delivering service. They closed my ticket immediately after their response and they didn't want to discuss it with me, but still refusing to return my money. So, they attract me to credit - didn't gave me.

The machine canceled in question gave me nothing but troubles , was under attack for at least once a month and also freezes from time to time , the IP was blacklisted by a game company for more than 6 months until i had to personally ask the game company to whitelist the IP. Confirmed with the game company that the IP was blacklisted before my acquisition of it to which OVH said they couldn't do anything so that's why i had to contact game company personally , that was done regardless of the months i paid for it for not being able to use it properly. I cancelled my service with OVH USA months ago this year also because my project in USA ended and customer support there was on the spot always , an answer within 1 hour and very attentive and supportive , they gladly ended my contract when i asked them to and understood that i cannot afford to pay something that's not used anymore and within the cancellation term. But OVH Europe they do not give a single damn, i made a ticket 4 days ago and they only answered me today after i literally had to message support on Twitter believe it or not. I did not intend to make a review on the company as my other machine works flawlesly but this today had me outraged by the neglicence those people deal with.

If you're going to pay more, then you may as well use a service with automation and support, if you want unmanaged (that still uses automation) use another service anyways. OVH cannot seem to scale with me they take days and days to process adding more RAM whereas any other service I used takes 5 minutes. Update: charged 3 times for the upgrade I requested 4 days ago, man it's a vps not a dedicated server otherwise I'd understand"
Michael,AU,"Jul 3, 2023",5,Outstanding,"I run a bare metal server with OVH Australia, and they have been fantastic. I have had some hiccups and there are some areas for them to improve, but honestly they are rock solid and every bit comparable to Vultr and other 2nd tier providers. I believe all of the negative reviews are likely from less technically minded people who have had issues and required hand holding. I haven't had to use their support, so it's possible they aren't that helpful. Pros - Pricing is literally the best by country mile (I did snap up a discounted rate offer) - Performance of the server has been blazing fast, and so far, 100% up time over the 3 months since I signed up - Enterprise grade interface / management portal from a functionality perspective Neutral - Server provisioning took ~4 hours - OS install was a bit clunky as I didn't set up the partitions correctly. The failure wasn't obvious, and required several attempts to enter recovery mode. This however was my fault, so whilst not an optimal UX, can't be blamed on OVH Negatives - Server installation email took a while longer than provisioning, therefore I couldn't find SSH access details. Hunted everywhere and gave up, intending to contact support, but email eventually arrived :) - SSH requests would periodically time out for the first day and the only way I could access the server was through IPMI. It has been rock solid since though, so might have been a DNS issue or something else I did. - Very slow interface / management portal. Takes forever to move from page to page. All in all, if you need a bare metal server, don't want to pay through the teeth and are willing to figure things out for yourself, these guys are worth every penny."

Oh, and eve THAT didn't work. And then, despite being signed in, they asked for ID before they'd remove the services on their side. I will NEVER use OVH services again. Their rating on here speaks volumes. UPDATE: Following OVH reply requesting more info, I submitted requested info. Unfortunately, despite saying they hoped I wouldn't have to go through this again, I did indeed have to go through this again this morning, and they have closed the ticket without resolution, so I've had to raise ANOTHER one explaining the whole thing again.

They brought in the chargeable IP addresses for each IP address that is now all chargeable. Feb 2020, they brought these chargeable services in then they stop them again as they had too many complaints about this chargeable service. So in 2023, they brought this in again so if you think about it as a loyal customer I've paid over 3 times the amount I should pay.

Dionis Ceban,MD,"Updated May 18, 2023",1,I am extremely disappointed with OVH's…,"Update 05/18/2023 I am deeply disappointed with OVH's lack of communication and failure to provide the promised refund on 05/11/2023. It has been a week since I was informed about the refund, yet I have received no answers or reimbursement. This level of service is unacceptable. Update 05/08/2023: The list of the IPs page or Services doesn't load, again cannot renew or cancel any service. Update 05/06/2023: I am writing to express my disappointment with the persistent issues I have been facing with the OVH Client Area. Despite repeatedly reporting issues with the scroll function, I have not seen any improvement in its performance. It is particularly frustrating that the scroll function does not work on Safari but I've noticed later it works on Chrome, which creates unnecessary inconvenience. Furthermore, I am disappointed with OVH's refusal to refund my payment for IPs, which amounted to 512 euro. I understand that I did not request a refund for the entire amount, including the dedicated server, but I merely asked for a refund for the payment for IPs, which was declined. This experience has left me feeling undervalued as a customer and dissatisfied with the service. I strongly advise potential customers against using OVH services. Not only does their client area not work reliably, but the services also fail to load properly at times. Due to the faulty client area, I have lost 512 euro, and I believe it is in the best interest of other customers to steer clear of OVH's services. I hope that OVH can take steps to address the issues I have raised, including improving the performance of the client area and addressing customer concerns in a more satisfactory manner. 04/29/2023 I am extremely disappointed with OVH's services. The company has increased its prices in the last half of the year without any improvement in the quality of their services. In fact, the quality of their services has worsened significantly. To make matters worse, their client area is full of bugs. For instance, I was unable to scroll the page or cancel a service. As a result, I was charged for a service that I wanted to cancel but couldn't because of their faulty website. Furthermore, OVH changed the terms and conditions for existing services. There is no support to speak of either. If you submit a support ticket, you'll be lucky to get a response within a week. Overall, I cannot recommend OVH's services to anyone. There are too many issues, and the company does not seem to be making any effort to improve their services or address their customers' concerns."

Xen,NL,"Updated Apr 13, 2023",1,I purchased a server for a year...,"I purchased a server for a year starting in June 2022. Everything worked fine until 2 months ago. I have been experiencing package drops for the last 2 months. The server was advertised as the ideal game server and for an amount of almost 100 euros per month you expect something. The package drops started 2 months ago. But according to OVH, nothing was wrong. They then intervened (4 hours after the agreed time...) and unplugged and plugged in the network cable while they were going to replace the cable. Then they replaced the cable from the wrong server. After that the problems were not solved. Then they went to replace the motherboard. After an hour I received a message that it was completed (while the server has not been offline. Great!). After a few days of fiddling, things remained fairly stable. Until the beginning of this week. Package drops again, lag, no connection, my ping monitors at 2 locations simultaneously found that no pings were received and at that moment all players were kicked and could no longer connect. OVH went to check again, they ran tests for 3 hours, nothing came out of this, and the problems suddenly got much worse. According to OVH, it is not their fault. Fantastic, is it definitely just me? After i have asked them to cancel my contract because i lost lots of community members due the disconnects, they simple say my contract can't be cancelled. After that, the server went down around 3-4 times a day and they now simply disabled the monitoring system so that the server does not create a ticket automatically. Unbelievable. As of today, i'm still bound to the contract. I have now asked them 2x nicely to cancel my contract immediately since they do not deliver what they promised me. I can't, I just have to follow their diagnostic steps for the umpteenth time. No! I don't want this anymore! Finished! I sincerely hope that everyone who is going to purchase a server from them has read this. Support is friendly, but poor. Prices are relatively cheap, but the quality is low. After 3 times of contacts via review sites they still say that they can't cancel the contract because it is a one-year contract. So they can let me pay each month a 100 euro's for a service that has a lot of problems. Unbelievable."

Simon,DK,"Apr 4, 2023",5,Great service -,"Like many others, surprised to see so many bad reviews. I have been an OVH customer for the last 20 years (since I was 13), I have always been very happy with their products. Yes it's a big company, and their products are rather cheap, so they have tons of customers. And yes customer service is maybe not the best, they probably struggle a little managing the huge amount of customers they have. But IMO there is nothing wrong with their products, very high availability, and they have not stopped improving for the last 20 years, creating the VPS, adding flexibility, improved the OVH manager, etc. The support usually takes a few days (at least) to answer, but you can pay more if you want more support (like 24/7), which I think is fair. I think a lot of these reviews are poeple who have had one bad experience with them and got very angry. Mistakes happen, it's more about how the company handles the mistake that matters. If you have a big issue I would recommend sending them a message on Facebook, just remember to be nice and polite :) Thank you for reading! Simon"

Laszlo Dudas,GB,"Mar 23, 2023",1,Stay away from OVH,"Stay away from OVH. They cancel your service without notice. The prepaid account is useless. My partner had a yearly paid VPS with ovh with an extra IP that she got for free. It was part of the package. In the middle of the year, they give the letter We will charge an extra 0.60 / month for an IP that was part of my package. I wasn't happy but We made a top-up to her account thinking that will cover this expense. First, they billed on the 15 of December later they changed it to the first of Jan... so 1 monthly payment covered 15 days. After They get the payment on the first of February in March they canceled my IP without noticing us. I guess getting back the same IP is not possible and customer service should give an answer in the next month We leave OVH with a bad experience after 8 years of working with them."

Ryuji Kun,US,"Updated Mar 13, 2023",1,Scam? The Worst Hosting Provider,"Last month I made an order for their promo VPS for 12 months. But a few days later my account was closed without any explanation, and I tried to open a new account with the same email to get clarity via support ticket. In the ticket they explained that I violated their terms and conditions in the contract, but did not explain what the violation was and how it happened, and they refused to refund my money. If you are trying to find a VPS for the long term, you should stay away from this one hosting company, because your account can be deleted at any time without any explanation and you will not get a refund. Customer service takes a very long time to respond. And of course you will find it very difficult to contact customer service, unlike most hosting providers who make it easy for customer service with live chat or fast ticket responses, you might even have trouble finding their support ticket. Not very user friendly. My worst experience in using a hosting service so far. Edit 13-3-2023 : There is no need for further explanation, the customer service explanation in the ticketing system is very clear, and I don't think it will make any difference if you take care of this matter. Your problem is in the terms and conditions that you have. Every hosting provider has an anti-fraud system, but only OVH has an anti-fraud system that is very sneaky to customers. The anti-fraud system on other hosting may refuse payment if it is detected as suspicious, or make a refund by canceling the transaction, then notifying the customer via email for clarification. But OVH doesn't have this, you just immediately delete the account, don't provide an explanation if the customer doesn't ask for it, and don't give a refund. That's all. After I saw many complaints on Trustpilot, it turns out that I'm not the only one experiencing something like this."

Despite the phishing files being deleted the minute we were notified by the OVH Abuse team on Friday morning, they still took down the server on Friday night for the whole weekend. It's now Monday afternoon and they still have not put my server back online. The tech support says I have to wait for the email from Abuse team because they can't do anything due to being a separate Dept. I sent the numerous emails to their Abuse team with no response since Friday!! And I am still waiting. As a result, I lost 8 clients as of today over the weekend and over $15,000 in revenue from those clients. I am speaking to a lawyer about suing OVH for loss of business and bad business practice.

Services will be awesome with 100% uptime without any issues. You will never need to open a ticket for service performance other than for billing or hardware errors. 2. Delivery period sucks. They would say that it's 120 seconds but it will definitely take more than 1 hour and in some cases 1 day, so order accordingly 3. Support is non-existant. So do not expect they would ever help you. The minimum time in which they reply now is like 1 day. 4. Their plans are charged based on bandwidth and they do not have resources in Dedicated servers mainly because they want to advertise their expensive public cloud. Feedback: Guys, don't give pricing like Hetzner, charge more if you want but at least give hardware resources as needed. Most of your servers have 10G NIC attached but you still only give 500Mbps with no option to upgrade it! Moreover, none of your servers have CPUs more than 8c/16t. Additionally, SYS and Kimsufi's Control Panel works great with speed whereas OVH Manager totally sucks, too much delay. I have to process everything from OVH API instead!"

They forced my account to again commit for another year and then once I tried to talk to OVH in a civil manner explaining that I do not wish for this commitment they simply told me to pay them a lot of money to terminate the service (remainder of a whole year worth money) or else continue using their services. This is pure extortion. I am not going to give you my money for service I won't be using. Absolutely disgraceful and inhumane company. On-top of this, I was being subtly threatened that I will be contacted by debt collectors if I fail to pay them in full. What a bull company. Please don't use their services, absolute madness.

Xortrox,NO,"Updated Jan 26, 2023",5,No respect for loyal customers,"Edit: OVH got in contact with me after this review and remedied the situation. It seems to have been a misunderstanding between us and we are now committed to our new server instead of the old server, which we deem as an acceptable solution to our issues. Been a loyal user of Kimsufi, SoYouStart, OVH and OVHCloud in total for over 7 years now. We were migrating to a new production server and only after doing a full migration we realized our old server was still on a commitment period, support was entirely unwilling to transfer this commitment or do anything to remedy the situation, so now we're ""bound"" to paying for the old unused server for 11 months, or terminate it with a ""termination fee"" which according to their ToS/agreements is the full outstanding commitment amount. On top of this, it became clear to us that there was actually no evidence of ever entering into this commitment, no emails, no spam emails, no invoices indicating that the agreement ever took place or a contract was signed. Support also tried to provide us with ""evidence"" of this by sending us generic server installation emails which they told us contained date stamps for the initial server purchase, and then the commitment change. None of the emails contained a single date, label or title indicating anything of what they said. They also kept mentioning the price changes in our invoices from the claimed commitment dates, but this is something we've literally been brushing off as a tax change ever since it happened. On top of this they told us they sent 2 emails on more than one occasion during these chats, and we only ever received the one generic undated email. When pointing this out to the chat representative it was met with ""you're choosing to ignore the evidence"". Ridiculous."

I opened a ticket (because talking to a human costs 72$ CAD/month) an they replied saying that they have to host the domain in order for the mailbox plan to be activated. I wasn't happy about that as the documentation stated otherwise. I then start the process of moving my domain over to them and on the 3rd day of seeing nothing move I open another ticket to which they reply that it's normal since they have to manually take action.

I just ordered a service, had been written the review here and you went and said 'yeah, man, you know, our anti-fraud blah said your payment is not okay for us'. It's a pity cause the same credit card is completely okay for a lot of things I paid before - from new domain names to taxi services - without any problem ever.

Due to outstanding invoice. Apparently they have been sending the email everyday updating the countdown . When I noticed the countdown showed me I still had 3 days remaining until deletion. I went into my Control Panel to pay the invoice before deletion & for some reason OVH wasn't taking my payment , tried to generate a new purchase order & it was re-routing me back to the dashboard . I have tried 4 different payment methods & contacted my bank , them telling me they don't see anything on their end. At this point, my service is about to get deleted & I have the money to pay but OVH doesn't want to accept it. So with no other options I contacted support. As we are in year 2023 now OVH Support for US Accounts has been the worst support ever! Live chat is always disable , they don't have a number to contact them, they inform you on their site to DM through twitter , but their twitter account hasn't been active since 2017. The only support I was able to reach was for OVH outside of the US Accounts , which they informed me they couldn't assist. So now my only options is to create a ticket & wait through email. Which I should mention is a terrible way to do support specially for people inn urgent matters, specially if it takes OVH days to respond..... Anyway the day I noticed my payments wasn't working I contact support VIA ticket. 3 days ago..... Today, my service got deleted due to not being able to pay my bill & still waiting on support to help me pay my bill.... I am extremely frustrated as I had very important information on my service , which no , isn't backup. The fact that I wanted to prevent this & OVH giving me billing issues & support not responding causing it to get deleted is very upsetting. I am currently STILL waiting for a response for a solution to get my service back or at least the data on my service. If support would of responded in a timely manner to assist , my services wouldn't have been canceled... I have been waiting & trying to make a payment for 3 days now for it to of just got deleted a few hours ago.... Is there any support I can get to help me with this matter?

All i just need is my money back ,a quick refund, i made a 2 years commitment so please don't debit my account again in the future.I don't want to answer any questions or be advised on anything just refund and close the account as i have switched to aws lightsail which is in everyway faster and quicker with easy resolution on any issues."
Evan,CA,"Dec 2, 2022",1,OVH refuses to refund,"In the European Union, consumers have the right to return the product within 14 days and receive a full refund from the merchant. However, OVH blatantly violated this practice by not only closing user accounts, but also refusing to refund. Their reason for refund is according to their user agreement. I want to say that these are written agreements that can be modified at any time. In the face of consumer rights, can you deceive consumers based on your user agreement? is this normal?

When I open a support ticket, it's 5-6 days to get a response and it never corresponds to what I actually wrote, so I'm sure the person isn't even reading my support ticket messages.

I've been using the same cards/paypal etc. over the years ordering cloud and dedicated servers withing few minutes from other providers, if you ask my advise, DON'T waste your time, their support and validation is like submitting for a domain name in 1998. order number CS6765573 ---- Update: after this they closed the account which was legit under my company name and domain, and held the money for 14 business days too.

So it charged me twice. Sent a Ticket 6 days ago now and had no response. Opened another last night and nothing to that one.

Chou-Tac Chung,VN,"Nov 23, 2022",1,Very Slow and Inefficient response from support,"I am with OVH for almost 10 years. Things go pretty smooth except 1 thing that is blocking me now. The recurring problem is when my blog's memory reach beyond the 800mo quota. OVH disable the writing mode without telling me in advance. A notification like: ""Your memory will reach your quota soon"", would be appreciated. Why? Because they suspend the writing mode till I contact them. And they take ages to respond. Meanwhile, I can't even log properly to Wordpress and suppress anything to solve the issue. I have to go through FTP. That's obviously no user friendly to clean up wisely the space. While the support was amazing a few years ago, the service is now horrible. They did unlock my blog, but after a long waiting. Then, I was trying to figure out a solution through restoration or activating plugin to lighten pictures ... that OVH locked the blog again! So I have to recontact them again, and wait for an unknown duration... Once, I solved the issue, but it last a few hours only. I restored my blog just before my last post publication. It went fine. My blog was back to normal. Yeah! So I could write again a new post. My 500mo jumped to 700mo. I was dubious, but I felt relieved since the blog worked. But during the night, it jumped to 830mo again while I was sleeping! Bam, OVH locked the account again. (So I have to recontact them and wait an eternity to get an answer...) I haven't yet figure out the issue on why the memory auto increase..... The thing I feel disappointed and frustrated is how OVH never answer my questions, and take days to give inefficient response. My problem is still unsolved since the 5th November 2022. Almost 3 weeks my blog is paralysed. It is not just a blog but my business. I usually do not give bad reviews of services. A friend told me while they may ignore me at the support, I may get heard by OVH writing here. Cross finger. Thank you for listening. Hoping OVH take this as a feedback to better help their customers."

Pablo Lema,BO,"Oct 27, 2022",1,The absolute WORST company,"Have you noticed OVH USA gets great reviews, but all other OVH sites get horrible reviews?

The absolute WORST company. They will make it as damn hard as possible for you to leave them. I had to spend hours with support today, I emailed them LAST WEEK that I was having trouble canceling a service on the dashboard. Today it AUTO RENEWED and it was just an endless back and forth to get that cancelled. Downgrading a server with addons is also impossible, they expect you to BUY another server and then they will TRANSFER your credit there, but you have ALREADY PAID for an extra server plus setup costs. The Dashboard sucks, and the dashboard and the support team will tell you different things. I had to send in a PDF of a Dashboard confirmation I got because support told me it didn't work that way, I am still waiting to hear back on that. NEVER, EVER get a commitment with them, it doesn't matter what they promise you. There is no negotiating or paying a few months as a fine to get out, THEY HAVE YOU BY THE BALLS. They make everything difficult on purpose. Like really difficult, like you need to interact with an API to downgrade bandwidth speed. Save yourself the trouble, its a shady, shady company. With a little search you can find CHEAPER and FAR MORE REPUTABLE companies that will not try to iron clad you to themselves. By force."

But recently there was a 20% cost hike on their services. What annoyed me was that they didn’t have the courtesy to inform me in advance; instead I learnt it from the increased bill. This made me look out for alternative options, and to my surprise I realised that there are many good alternatives to DO out there. The OVH caught my attention with its long industry experience and I feel they are the “Second” company Jeff Bezos highlighted in one of his famous quotes. “There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second.” - Jeff Bezos. Now my first VPS is running on OVH for many weeks, and I am more than happy with their service.

Hsins,TW,"Updated Sep 19, 2022",2,Making VAT Exemption Difficult by Asking Item not Mentioned in Advance,"That's a really bad experience. I opened a ticket for applying the VAT exemption because I'm a customer not in Europe. The first man deals with this ticket ask for the proof of identity (ID card/passport or driver license) and the proof of address (utility bill or bank statement). After submitted the documents, he pass the ticket to the financial department. Then the second man make me submit the documents again and emphasis that the documents should be in English. That's really unreasonable for asking the ID card should be in English. And the labels title in the bill are marked with English. That's totally enough for recognition. They ask the translations not mentioned in former message or their agreement. I've searched for the experiences for VAT exemption, the translations seems not the mandatory item. That impose the burden on customers outside the Europe. EDIT 2022/09/16: As I mentions: (1) The requirement of translation is not shown on both the ticket message former, the agreement or any guide or rule on your site. (2) It's ridiculous that ""translation by the certified institute"" is mandatory. I've browsed most of the posts on the Internet (e.g. personal blog/LowEndTalk forum/hostloc forum... etc). The statement you told me seems totally a pack of lies. Refer to one of the posts: ""准备水电单，银行账单，话费账单，得带地址，中英文无所谓。你甚至可以用淘宝的交易界面 F12把名字账单改成自己的 拿chrome自带的网页翻译翻译成英文，最后截图。"" ""Prepare for the utility bills, bank statement or mobile rental bill with address, no matter in Chinese or English. You can even translate your Taobao transaction page with default translation tool of Chrome by pressing F12"" EDIT 2022/09/19: Finally, I got the VAT exemption passed.

OVH is dedicated to not living up to their own advertising, and dodging all responsibility rather than making things right. This used to be an excellent, reasonable-cost hosting company, but you can't trust them to keep their word any more. While other options will likely cost you more initially, they will actually provide support and you'll get what you are sold. An update, weeks later: You'll notice a reply from OVH to this review offering to review this in my existing support ticket; Their response was an empty promise to escalate to their ""claims department"" and then two weeks of complete and utter silence.

I purchased a VPS and it said it can take up to 48hours. After this time had passed I checked my account to find the order was cancelled. I raised a support ticket as I have recieved no email saying why. I was told I needed to provide ID and my provided information was either false or wrong. I provided ID and was told I can purchase again, I purchased and 48 hours later I found my account was locked. Again no email notification. I had no way of raising a support ticket to find out what was wrong. So I created another account to raise a support ticket to be given a link for their Abuse/Fraud team. This lead to a form where all of the options required that I needed to input an IP address or website name, it would not let me pick one at random so I had no way of filling it out. I responded to the support email telling them this to be told to use the link as described but as I have already said it doesn't allow me to. Avoid this company like the plague!"

Paid for domain renewal but OVH did not deliver the service. UPDATE: Domain Expires Date: August 7 2022 August 2, automatic renewal triggered, payment completed and invoice generated, and email from OVH telling me that the renewal was successful (but no, it wasn't) On August 7, the domain expired, but there was a 10-day grace period according to the rules. At this point the status is still ""ok"" On August 12, WHOIS showed it was still ""ok"", but OVH didn't do anything. On August 17, it expired for more than 10 days and entered the redemption period according to the rules, and the status changed to ""pendingDelete|serverHold"". At this point, the domain was suddenly stopped resolving without any notice, causing my business to be affected. I submitted a support ticket to OVH, but the technical team incorrectly assumed the cause was the ""hold"" status of the domain, which is faulty logic that reverses cause and effect. The domain was "" hold "" because OVH did not deliver the renewal service, not because the "" hold "" status caused the failure to renew. Also, the ""hold"" status does not affect OVH's ability to deliver renewals. On August 21, after I provided a photo of my personal ID, the support ticket was closed for no reason. I then reopened the support ticket, but unfortunately the support team still incorrectly believed that the ""hold"" was the cause of the problem. OVH incorrectly assumes that the cause of the incident is the ""hold"" status of the domain, pushes the responsibility to an unsupportable reason, and refuses to refund. I have filed a complaint with DGCCRF and ICPEN and am considering legal action. Yes, they cheated me out of my money. Stay away from OVH"
Review Spot,GB,"Aug 19, 2022",4,Amazing dedicated server hosting,I've never had anything bad to say about OVH after using them for over 4 years now. I've used many dedicated servers and they've been perfect. The only fault is that I had a domain forums.me.uk expire and every time I tried to renew it I got an error. I contacted their support who told me to try again but it still wouldn't work. Now the domain has been lost.

They don't want me create a public cloud project,"If I could rate this service with negative value I'd put -100 because I was suffering how much the support is bad, dumb. I'm talking with robots in tickets. They have 0 IQ. I have never seen a support bad as this one. Ticket: 6092110 Username: ck13xxx1-ovh Country: Tunisia (I can't disclose my username here publicly) I tried to create a public cloud project like I used to do in other 2 accounts a year ago. I found that I can only pay with international credit card as the only option. But ironically, I can buy OVH credits with any method available here in Tunisia. I bought few credits as a minimal requirement and I asked the support to create the project for me because we don't have international credit cards in Tunisia and even the CTI card is not working in OVH (the tunisian ""monétique"" said that the CTI card doesn't work in OVH because OVH is using TND currency while the CTI card is supposed to be used in foreign websites). I have shared even screenshots about the issue in the message number 7 (16/08/2022 14:22 UTC+1). But guess what is the reply of the customer support? They sent me this link www dot ovh dot com/tn/support/documents_legaux/payment.xml and they told me that these are the payment methods. Are you kidding me? I said it in many replies that they only available method is the international one and you came with a useless reply? I kept asking to escalate this to a responsible but they are ignoring me. At the end they closed the ticket with this message ""For the moment if you do not have an international or technological card, you cannot create your project."" are they tard? Even when I explain the issue to kid he will understand it.

Mees,NL,"Jul 15, 2022",3,What You See Is What You Get,"TL;DR OVHcloud is a typical case of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). You get the service you paid for, but do not expect any additional features or services. Keep your expectations low when choosing for OVHcloud, and ensure that you have sufficient experience with managing a server, OVHcloud won't help you. If you are looking for a VPS provider more modern and adapted to the newest standards and technologies, seek further. In addition to what I have written above, OVHcloud feels/is outdated. Their dashboard where you can manage your services looks outdated and is terribly slow. In addition to that, OVHcloud's support for IPv6 is very poor, they only give you a /128 per VPS with no way to get more addresses. First of all, the /128 is problematic when you are planning to run mailservers on your VPS with support for IPv6, as spam filters like Spamhaus blacklist whole /64 when an IP in that range sends spam. This means that if someone else within the same /64 block on OVHcloud sends spam, you will be blacklisted in common spam filters as well. Second, if you really only want to give /128's to servers, at least give people the option to get multiple /128's (like how it is possible for IPv4 addresses on OVHcloud). Third, the anti-DDoS feature OVHcloud adverts only applies to IPv4. Your IPv6 traffic is left unprotected, which is awful and misleading. OVHcloud should properly mention that their anti-DDoS feature only applies to IPv4. The same story goes for firewalls, you can only set them for your server's IPv4 address(es), not for your server's IPv6 address. Next, the propagation time of VPS. OVHcloud promises to propagate VPS within 120 seconds. During the time I was renting VPS at OVHcloud I haven't seen my ordered or upgraded VPS propagate within the promised 120 seconds. Instead, the average propagation time was around 30 to 60 minutes. The VPS offered by OVHcloud are fine and I didn't have issues with them. For the price you are paying, I think the price to quality ratio is quite good when it comes to the VPS performance. The bandwidth that comes with your VPS usually is in the range of the guaranteed bandwidth you're paying for and doesn't come with a limit, which is a huge pro compared to other VPS providers. Conclusion: OVHcloud is fine as long as you are fully capable of managing your own server. Do not expect to get any help from their customer support team to avoid getting disappointed. If you are seeking a provider more modern, seek further. If proper IPv6 support is a must for you, OVHcloud isn't the provider you should go with. Do you have a tight budget and do you want to host bandwidth-intensive applications? OVHcloud is the provider you should go with."
Jelle Demeestere,BE,"Updated Jul 19, 2022",3,Not very easy to contact support,"This is an absolute nightmare of a company: whenever you have a problem, you are directed to standard ""solutions"" for whatever question you have, which never lead to a resolution of the problem. They are also impossible to contact. I would definitely look elswhere for your hosting. Answer to OVH response: we cannot access an authentication code, since the email address to which it will be sent no longer exists. That's why we are trying to change that email address. Could you please provide us with a solution, or give us a way to contact you directly? EDIT: After being in direct contact with OVH, we managed to obtain the necessary information. Would be helpful to have the availability to contact OVH directly from the website instead of being sent through a FAQ tool. Thanks for the support."
SixXen,SG,"Jul 9, 2022",1,Low outgoing 100Mbps instead of promised 500Mbps,"Customer for 5 years, and I can feel there's no improvement regarding customer service, maybe gone the other way instead. Recently I order a new server in SGP with 500Mbps IN/OUT transfer, but from test the actual REAL speed for outgoing is only 100Mbps. This is clearly againts the contract! Yet no one in OVH seems to concern about it. There's no reply when contacted (ticket 5855755), no fix yet so far. I'm losing hope already and start to find alternative. AFAIK, this is technical problem, shouldn't the NOC manned 24/7? Why can't the staff in NOC quickly correct the speed? This 100Mbps outgoing speed (instead of 500Mbps as per contract) cause the new server unuseable for our need. Please OVH, have some sense of crisis and empathy for your customer. This is wasting time and the server can't put into production because we'll have complaints from users for the low speed."

Your site keeps taking me to login when I try to get help... so I have no other option. Edit: OVHCloud US and OVHCloud are not two completely different entities. They are subsidiaries under the same ownership. Your website should better differentiate that, and your EU branch should be able to guide people who just go to ovhcloud.com on whom to contact within the US subsidiary. To wait >2 days for an email that says nothing more than ""you need to call your local support representative"" with no way of actually calling or getting help (you don't publish a number, or a contact method) is a bit absurd. I'm done doing business with OVH and will ensure I recommend people move away. Edit again: You are all part of OVH Group... so you all work for the same entity. The EU guys didn't tell me how to contact, a very blank ""phone your local support representative"" is all they could be bothered to send after *2* days. That is pure laziness and a poor support attitude. The least they could've done is have an avenue on how to contact a subsidiary within the same company.

It all got settled. Not the way i chose to, but to avoid the neverendless struggle and pointless discussions we manage it anyway. I wish things were handled differently. I wont lie that this situation with ovh got to me personal and i do hope in the future i will get it out of my system ( mind ) I truly believe in the end they can fix what went wrong. They have a huge portfolio of great products so if someone is ever looking for vps or dedicated servers ovh is a good option, and than pray you never need to customer support that i received. OR you will experience the opposite. Time will tell, people can learn, companies can Change. With a lot of love and thank you for reading this. Peace, love and i wish you the best Health. Regards, Michael"
Juuso Alasuutari,FI,"Updated May 4, 2022",4,Had an issue but customer service helped.,UPDATE: below is my original review. I was contacted by OVH's customer service and was able to login and renew my domain. The swift response deserves a bump in my rating. I hope OVH will focus on improving their systems to reduce technical issues which in turn require customer service to step in. ---- original review begins here ---- Tried to renew my domain. Couldn't log in because their 2-factor auth simply wouldn't send the SMS! My domain is probably now gone because it was due to expire yesterday when this happened. Tried everything I could to no avail. I know my password is correct because I was able to reset it. OVH's login page accepts my username + password and then says the SMS was sent. The partly visible phone number shown looks correct. But no god damned SMS after 10 hours of trying over and over again!
Kashra Serversysteme,DE,"Apr 18, 2022",2,"They once were good, but are not anymore","I am a customer of OVH for more than 5 years now, so I feel competent to write a review which provides a complete picture regarding being a customer with OVH. I signed up with OVH in 2016 for a simple VPS. It was good, just plain simple, easy to use, fast and low cost (about 4€) with phone support for free. I used it for failover NTP services. Everytime one of my company´s NTP servers needed hardware service, the traffic was routed to this little OVH VPS box and it answered the requests. Now I have a few hundred NTP servers worldwide and upgraded the VPS as well as ordered two additional VPS servers. I noticed OVH did go a long way down since 2016. The service panel was basically untouched since 2016. Features like cloning one VPS image to setup another are not there. You have to manually install everything by starting with one of their few images to choose from. (I did not and used the ""rescue"" net boot and iSCSI to load my own image to the VPS) After ordering 16 additional ""failover"" IP addresses from different countries I noticed I could NOT assign them to the VPS. Why? Because they can only be assigned to a server in the same datacenter. They are FAILOVER IPs. The name implies that you can use them to switch the IPs to another server if your server fails. Like server A fails, you switch the failover IPs to server B and don´t need to rush the repair of server A, because all requests are with server B. But you can´t switch these failover IPs to a different server, because the server needs to be in the SAME datacenter to do so. How stupid is that? These failover IPs are geolocated to different countries, but OVH locks them to the datacenter of the VPS you order them for. Like a french VPS gets assigned a failover IP from Germany, but you can not assign the german failover IP to a german OVH server. I can not even tell how stupid that is, because the customer needs to order all servers in the same datacenter to use the failover IPs. If there is no free servers in the datacenter, well too bad for the customer. The next thing I noticed is that I got a lot of emails from OVH. They read Anti-Hack ""Attack to IP-Address x.x.x.x"" Once the server gets traffic, OVH just blocks the server from getting the traffic by routing the traffic to their ""protected network"" so the server is no longer ""under attack"". The problem is, the server is basically offline because the traffic is rerouted away from it to an OVH blackhole network. They write that ""legitimate"" traffic is not affected, but it is. So, once the server gets NTP traffic, OVH thinks ""oh no, an attack, let´s protect the server by blocking the traffic until there is no more traffic"". And they keep blocking it until the traffic is very low. The worst thing is: They provide a firewall in the web interface. You can deactivate it if you like, but it is forcefully activated as soon as an ""attack"" is taking place and you can not disable the firewall until the ""attack"" is over. Since their phone support is no more in Germany, I wrote several tickets, and they usually took a few days to get to it by sending one reply every day requesting nonsense information like ""what is the server used for?"" and ""is legitimate traffic blocked?"" and ""which ports are affected?"" Once you answered all their questions, they ""do some things"" so you are not receiving the ""anti hack"" emails anymore and the firewall triggers less often. But they can not disable the DDOS system, they only can enter some values, according to a response I got. To sum it up: #1 The customer interface is old and has very few features. No custom image to install, no way of cloning a VPS. No options to configure the VPS in any way. You can upgrade it to the next better product, but there is no downgrade path an no options like configure the amount of RAM or CPU cores you want, like there is with 1and1 / IONOS. #2 Their firewall is just dumb. It filters legitimate traffic by routing it to a blackhole once there is some traffic (in my case only 30Mbit/s) #3 Their ""failover"" IPs can only be assigned to a server in the same datacenter. Even though they are geolocated to different EU countries, they can not be used with OVH servers in theses countries, the servers must be in the same datacenter. #4 The support system is only available by ticket, the international phone support just tells you ""write a ticket"". The tickets gets answered once every working day, but only by sending out text blocks with nonsense questions, which have already been answered before. #5 The host system hardware is old. They use haswell systems for their VPS (model name: Intel Core Processor (Haswell, no TSX) The processor is a Gen 3 Xeon CPU and was good in 2016. We now have 2022 and Gen 12 Intel CPUs. All I can say is: They were good, but are not any more. There are many others which are way better like Hetzner, IONOS, DigitalOcean."
Mark Roberts,GB,"Apr 16, 2022",1,Avoid! The reviews here are accurate.,"I purchased an online exchange account with this company and set up the mailboxes. I then proceeded to use their mail migration tool which is clearly included as a service on their website. This failed with various errors and so I raised a ticket. I was told that support was only offerered by an online guide. This online guide covers no aspects of errors or problems and so cannot be considered 'support'. I pushed further and was told that the tool was working fine. It clearly doesn't. I pushed further and was told they would look into it if I paid for premium support. Outrageous to supply a tool that doesnt work and to then try and charge for supporting it. They also refuse a refund as I have now taken my business elsewhere - and incidentally, the mail migration process worked fine with the new company. I have lodged a chargeback as the only way of getting my money back and reported this company to UK Trading Standards as the practices here are borderline scams."
Jean F,NL,"Apr 14, 2022",3,"Support needs improvement, same with quality.","I recently ordered a KS-14 dedicated server to realise after payment, that additional IPs are unable to be purchased which was the whole point of the dedicated server in the first place. Furthermore, I had opened a ticket to request additional IPs as I wasn't aware at the time that I wasn't able to order additional IPs for Kimsufi servers ordered from OVH or Kimsufi, simply didn't know about it. Their support team replied with useless answers stating I can order via the API when I can't, their team was clueless about my issue which took about 2 weeks to fully resolve. After that, they replied stating that I can't order additional IPs for my Kimsufi server which I hadn't known about as stated above & it wasn't all that visible on their eco page. Apart from that, I had noticed that the drives were also failing right after I opened the ticket. With that out of the way, I wanted a refund so I replied to ticket countless times stating that for about a week with no answer, I then contacted them on Facebook where Max R. replied & helped me out within a great response time (About 2 days) which was very easing considering I've been basically talking to myself inside my ticket. Today my refund was processed all because of Max, once again - if you see this, thank you 💓."
Alex,AU,"Apr 14, 2022",1,"Pricing is good, not support.","Have had servers with OVH for many years, support is basically non-existent which is fine if you can manage things yourself. However recently I needed to upgrade multiple cPanel licenses purchased through OVH. Their upgrade function doesn't work on their website at all for a license, the delete license function doesn't work (To remove & add a new one), I contacted support with a request which took literally over 1 month for a reply. The reply was providing API information to run an upgrade. Which also didn't work. Then after a long wait of a few weeks, I was told to delete the license & re-add. Unfortunately the delete function failed with no reason. Now replied to my ticket and expecting another review. On one of my accounts I requested a review into compensation for lost customers & affected customers due to inability to upgrade/expand my license (And being capped at the limit at the time). Rejected as the license was functional (Albeit, only to the limit of 100 accounts). I wouldn't care about compensation if I could upgrade a license without waiting 30 days."
AL Sol,BE,"Updated Apr 13, 2022",2,"Delivery times and ""support"" are a joke","The support and delivery times are mind-blowingly awful. So is the communication related to that. We've ordered several servers in Frankfurt with a delivery time of 72h. After about a week of ordering, we still didn't receive any server or communication from OVH so we decided to reach out. After going back and forth and begging for an ETA, we received the following response: ""The server might be ready at the end of the month."" (while we're only 12 days in the month). Nothing else. I understand that there's a global hardware shortage and that certain parts are difficult to get. What I don't understand is why their website claims delivery times that are flat-out lies. We were planning on doing a mass migration to OVH from a previous provider but the experience has been dreadful so far. I'm not sure if we can rely on OVH for our growth. EDIT: I have provided you with my details and I'm looking forward to an update as to how something like this can happen."
Robert Spragg for Yellowstone,GB,"Apr 9, 2022",1,Beware of auto-renewal,"We have been using OVH for a number of years. The big hosting companies all have their flaws, but we always considered OVH to be one of the better ones. Yes, the tech support leaves a lot to be desired - almost always either a linux kernel breaks or a hard drive fails. Hard drive failures are handled very swiftly - but we still need to hire a linux engineer to fix the software side of things and get the server back up and running after any of these events. The positives of dealing with OVH have, up until recently, outweighed the negatives....until the time came when we went to cancel two of our services. After suffering kernel corruptions (requiring us to keep booting from a network kernel instead) late last year, we decided to commence a round of replacements for two of our servers, out of the 15 or more services with OVH. The two boxes in question were taken out in December 2019 and January 2020, so we were well out of the original one year contract (or so we thought !). Three new servers were initiated in January 2022 in order to migrate the websites from the two troublesome boxes. The process of moving the data had been quite slow due to staff absences due to covid, and other issues we were facing with the out-of-date versions of linux on both the new and old servers. We were all geared up to cancel the two old servers by the beginning of April, one week ahead of the monthly renewal cycle...except we couldn't find the cancellation option. It turns out that sometime between our previous batch of servers being taken out in 2017 and the next round in 2019, OVH have changed their auto-renewal policy. After the initial one year commitment, all of our services always dropped down to monthly commitment automatically, but it seems that now they autorenew for either one or two years (whatever your initial contact is). We did not know anything about the change in procedure. This behaviour is diabolical and now means we are expected to pay for two unused servers for 6 and 9 months respectively, even though we have replaced them with THREE further dedicated servers. I have complained and moaned and got absolutely nowhere. The initial support ticket was opened 9 days before the usual monthly renewal...by 2 days to renewal we hadn't even had a response. Only a phonecall to them kicked the whole process into life. We do not wish to move away from OVH at the moment, but I am quite prepared to wait until both servers have expired in order to get a final and quantifiable monetary value that we have overspent with them, in order to issue court proceedings to get this money back at a later date ! Beware everybody and make sure you change the settings of each and every server you take out with them in order not to be trapped like we were !"
xSunLighTx3,DE,"Apr 9, 2022",5,High quality hoster for business,"I'm hosting on OVH cloud for several months now and currently I have a plesk hosting for my web projects. The uptime of my server is 100% without any downtimes and the performance is pretty good and consistently, even for a cloud server. The plesk license package is pretty cheap and recommended from my side. OVH servers itself are not the cheapest on the market but the quality is very high. You can easily upgrade resources (cpu, ram, ssd) in your ovh customer center whenever you want. The support also helped me when I had problems but it takes 2-3 days for a reply (standard customer support). I know hoster who replies after 10 minutes consistently. OVH could maybe improve that. One of my website got a DDoS attack and OVH has immedately mitigrated the DDoS to secure my hosting. Even single DoS attacks will be blocked by OVH. If you running a reverse proxy such as cloudflare, you have to care yourself about DDoS. Overall I'm very happy and I will buy further OVH services soon."

OutOfSpace,NL,"Feb 14, 2022",4,It's all about expectations!,"I guess lot's of people here with bad reviews are just expecting something that OVH is not able to provide (yet). OVH was (and due to their 'poor' support, still is) for people who know how to run their own sites/systems/servers. If you don't know how to operate one of those (in depth); just stay away and choose another party, because once you need support you probably going to be dissatisfied. For those that DO know how to run their own stuff, OVH is a solid place to be. And yes, their support service definitely has lots of room for improvement, but my experience (for over 8 years now) is that they always fix the things - which are completely out of my hands - in a reasonable time frame. Also don't forget OVH is one of the largest cloud providers in Europe (if not THE largest) and tall trees just catch much wind. To put it in perspective: There are over 18 million sites hosted on OVH and about 1000 'bad' reviews here on Trustpilot; you do the math."
Modestas Baranauskas,LT,"Updated Feb 14, 2022",1,"Servers are good (not DDoS protection), support is non existent","Servers are good. Yet support is basically non-existent. DDoS protection is far from advertised. All good until you face a bigger attack which OVH isn't able to deal with. Then you are left alone to deal with it yourself. Servers getting attacked daily, OVH protection detects attack yet it still goes through that protection and drops legitimate traffic. I opened ticket, sent wireshark captures during the attack, explained everything else I knew with few messages. Next day I get an answer that I didn't send some of the necessary info (while I sent it in couple separate messages). It honestly seems like its just some bot answering the tickets who can read only the last message... Anyways, I answered 30min after I get answer on the ticket (with all information in one message), and no more answer in 2 days. I don't know if they are working on it, I don't know if they even seen my message, nothing. I believe if server is getting attacked hourly - it should trigger some priority to take a look at it. But nah, I guess I am just ""too small"" of a customer they would actually care about.. So 3 days later they reply that there is no solution if attacks are coming from OVH network. And all I can do is to report IPs from attack for abuse team. Would be hell of a solution if there weren't 500 IPs~ spamming over 40000 packets in seconds. So basically, you buying a dedicated server from game gamma (with, advertised DDoS protections specially adapted for games) then you also need remote DDoS protection from somewhere else (which cost additionally of course). So maybe its worth to think about less expensive alternatives with ""worse"" protection before falling into OVH"

Nicolaj Madsen,DK,"Jan 21, 2022",1,It is a NO from me.,"I ordered a pretty big server from them on a commitment-- The order itself included several additional upgrades to ram and IPv4s. The commitment period was 2 years. After about 10 months, the company I was using the server for went bankrupt, and so I write in to OVHCloud to review my options for the server- I needed to reduce the cost of it, or if possible at all then cancel it despite the commitment period. Unfortunately for me, OVH doesn't want to remove the unused additional Ram or IPv4s, so now I am stuck with an overpriced machine that has unnecessary upgrades. What pisses me off the most, is that they've since my purchase gone ahead and completely removed the Product I purchased-- And instead moved it to a different category at a much lower price than originally. I requested the difference as a discount, given that they are obviously ripping me off, and yet again despite my financial trouble, my company going bankrupt and past loyalty, OVH still refuses to provide me with any type of help or discount. Their ""Support Team"" also has to be one of the smallest teams I've seen- On average it takes them 6+ days to answer, and their answer is always the same ""Sorry you can't have X, our rules are Y but we can offer Z"" without any concern for what you've just actually said, and the ""offer Z"" often being an affront. In my case, they offered me to pay the full commitment immediately (With no discount naturally) to receive some ""loyalty"" bonuses-- Which I find to be a joke when I'm writing in to ask them to *lessen* the monthly burden, not dump it all into one. I can't help but to feel like every other reputable alternative server provider, with almost no exceptions, could provide a better, more all-rounded and cheaper experience than OVH could. TLDR: * Had a 2 year commitment, needed a discount (since the cpu has gotten cheaper on OVH) or to remove all upgrades on my server, only for OVH to refuse after leaving me waiting for days * OVH doesn't have a support team, expect to be left on ""read"" for 6+ days. * OVH will likely refuse to help you in any way, shape or form and offer a computer/bot sounding reply every time after waiting 6+ days. * OVH will charge you more than their competitors for the same product with worse service. * I suggest Hetzner as an European alternative to OVH, and practically any other provider as a global alternative. At the end of the day, I'm not that much against how OVH handles things, and just a few months ago I may have given them four stars, but to refuse removing ""Upgrades"", to refuse to apply a discount to a loyal customer when all NEW customers receive it and to then ignore my plea for help and insult me with an offer that is the exact opposite of what I need? Never again making a purchase from OVH."

I understand there's no support, i get that but when it comes down maintain your network and hardware, please do it. I have empty server just sitting there for months, they had ddos attack few days in a row, i logged in my server and apparently someone is using my IP to reroute spam emails.??? I don't have a single website hosted, it's empty server. I opened support ticket with explanation and as a usual it takes them days to respond with generic messages, probably copied and pasted with answer that, ""this issue its out of our support scope"". How is it out of your support scope? It's your network, you should keep your IP clean and not being blocked and blacklisted and have server full with spammers. On the top of that i signed up for 2 years, since they had tempting deal, but now they telling me i can't break the commitment and cancel the server. Who does that? It's a hosting, you don't pay, it's canceled. I guess ovh isn't good for businesses, instead it's good spammers to take a crap on their servers. Stay away from them!"

It's paid and taken from my bank account but no confirmation and 1.5 days later and still no servers... Called the helpdesk, where I had to wait around 20 minutes before someone came up and said: there's no solution at the moment. 'Just' wait until Monday, and if there's not chance, then I can put it forward to the data center. The other option is to call the sales department, which I did directly. But when pressing through the menu, after the final option I got a message: Sorry but this option is not available at the moment and the connection was stopped... How on earth is this called a service? Someone at a helpdesk is not able to help, the sales department is closed at Friday at 14:00h and the instruction is just to wait. They already have the money for the service but the service itself is not delivered. If I need to wait until Monday I lost 5 days where I paid for plus valuable time to work on the transition for the servers.... Edit 17-1-2021: Wouldn't it be right to put that explicit on the website when people change the configuration of the server, the delivery time will be longer? 'Delivered as soon as possible'. I've been told it can take as much time that the expectation and HOPE is that it will be there at the beginning of next week. That makes almost waiting 2 weeks on these 2 servers. I still don't call this as a service and far from helping your customers quickly. Because of this situation we now have to look at other providers such as Contabo.com as we need the servers this week. We might move away completely from OVH if they succeed to deliver quickly..."

jinit,GB,"Updated Jan 31, 2022",1,WAITING FOR £12.00 REFUND STILL.,"30 Nov 2021 14:04:14 – original order. I received the authCode from customersupport-ovh.co.uk on 30/11/2021 14:02 which was applied straightaway. Order was then cancelled as OVH failed to take/accept payment of £0.00 for the transfer. 06 Dec 2021 – 2nd order Received the authCode from customersupport-ovh.co.uk on 06/12/2021 00:06 which again was applied straightaway. But again the same error where OVH would not accept the £0.00 transfer payment. After which the ticket support were opened up. However, now the TAG had been changed from 123-REG to OVH-fr at some point after 6th December 2021. After repeated attempts to sort this matter out, it was clear that OVH had no clue what they were saying. As OVH kept on saying to look out for a new authCode, but I fail to understand why I would be needing a new authCode when the domain is already with the OVH-fr TAG. I was trying to move my domain to OVH. After getting in contact with Nominet, it was clear the domain was with OVH-fr, as this was the TAG on it. So OVH had completed the transfer but were keeping the domain away from my account. The only way to take control over my own domain was to pay Nominet £12.00 fee to get the domain released away from OVH. So please explain how you still believe that it’s not OVHcloud at fault from your ‘thorough verification’? SINCE OVH HAVE STOPPED REPLYING TO ME - 16 DAYS SINCE LAST CONTACT. TICKET 3456559 --- UPDATE 31/01/2022 - after a month, they finally replied the following: 'Thank you for your patience. Your request has been taken care of. After having analyzed your request your claim concerns the operation paid on the registry Nominet. Therefore, we are not in a position to respond favorably to your request for compensation, we will not cover the indicated fee.' Be very careful if you use this company, they will take your domain from you and keep it in their control, to which you'll have to pay £12 fee to Nominet to get it released from this horrible company."

It's been over a week since I submitted my verification documents and I've yet to receive a single response or update. I messaged them on Twitter to ask how long the ticket processing times are and they haven't replied to that either. I can understand that ticket queues might be long sometimes, but keeping customers (or would-be customers) completely in the dark for over a week is completely unacceptable.

Harry,GB,"Updated Jan 9, 2022",2,Questionable at best,"I started using OVH at the end of August due to their reputation. I liked the look of their website and their panel was generally user-friendly, which was great for me, because this would be my first time owning a dedicated server. The server specifications were as advertised (kind of - I was meant to have ""1Gbps bandwidth"", which was later discovered to be ""at least 500Mbps"", and quite often we weren't even getting that - but regardless, the machine itself was very capable), and the server was delivered in a few minutes, which was great. Monitoring was fantastic, and the on-site technicians fixed problems we sometimes didn't even know existed. Our server was located in the Canada BHS7 datacenter, as that was the location best for us at the time. This is where the issues began. Our datacenter choices immediately became a problem. Presumably, this specific datacenter had an issue with connection consistency, meaning that latency was all over the place. I was able to replicate this near the end of December by purchasing a second, less powerful dedicated server in the same location, and getting the exact same results. This meant we had spent 3 months (pretty much our entire time with OVH) attempting to optimise our programming only to discover that it wasn't even our fault. Bandwidth speeds, as mentioned earlier, randomly dropped catastrophically due to this issue. I requested a refund through their ticket system for the second server I had purchased a few hours after finding the issue (22nd Dec). Eight days later (30th Dec), I had to create a second ticket as they had responded that they'd ""get back to me"" (sent on 28th Dec) and I had heard nothing since - the ticket had even been marked as closed. Around two weeks after my initial purchase, I finally got a ""useful"" response. The refund request was denied. Will you have the same experience? I can only speak on what I've had to deal with, but if you're purchasing a server for something important, I wouldn't test your luck. Needless to say I've moved away. For reference, the machines I purchased were the ""Game-2"" (the main machine) and the ""Game-1-LE"" (the machine I purchased to test my initial theory)."
Chris,GB,"Updated Jan 18, 2022",1,"Servers may be good, but customer service stinks","I ordered a server with them on the 4th of December, it was advertised as 72 hour setup. It's now the 18th of Jan and still no server. Even worse they are completely blanking my tickets asking for information on what is going on. I've been waiting for a response to one ticket for 26 days (I got a generic response 19 days ago saying they would be back to me shortly with more information, and nothing since, and another one when Maxime wrote a reply here, with basically an identical ""we'll get back to you"" 6 days ago and nothing since, I don't consider that an answer). Waiting 45+ days for a server advertised as 72 hour setup is bad enough, but the absolutely unprofessional practice of not bothering to reply to support tickets with any details on what the hell is going on is by far the worst part. I have absolutely no idea if they are out of stock, waiting to see if servers become available, or if they have no intention of ever providing a server, all I do know is they have been holding on to my payment for the last 45 days. It's a real shame. I've been a customer for 10 years, but haven't had a server with them for many years. I was actually pretty excited to have a server with them again, but they clearly just don't care about their customers."

Rekha Sharma,IN,"Updated Jan 2, 2022",1,"Beware with OVH, very bad experience","Servers are good, but their abuse team is very worst, No respond on email and call, They just suspend all services even a single abuse complain, even delete billing account, If you are using servers for shared hosting then please don't get servers from OVH, because in shared hosting lots of website hosted and you can not 100% sure about compromising the website, you can secure the server as possible, but OVH abuse team are non technical they think the all servers are hacked and just stop all servers no matter in how many servers you have. They don't even give the chance to fix single website issue and just stop all servers while issue in one server's single website. everybody know in shared hosting users are not fully technically and lots of are using open source scripts like WordPress and sometime its hacked due to security leak/properly non secure configuration because they are just beginners and start learning that’s why getting shared hosting, So services provider can only suspend the website and inform the users to fix the issue by getting help form senior developers. but OVH team stop all servers of services provider and even don't give the chance to fix the issue. OVH stooped my entire business for more then 7-10 day, anyhow i got backup by rescue mode but if you are technically, can think how difficult to get backup of all VMs from rescue mode and restore them in new nodes. I loose my Master node data as well. Normally every good datacenter give 24-72 hours to fix the abuse cases. if no response after 72 hours then can stop infected server only due to network security not all servers which are not infected, but OVH stop all servers and even terminate your billing account as well. I asked them can block email ports OR null route the IP then make server online after i can fix the issue within 5 minutes by suspend infected website and inform the users to fix the infected website. but they don't listen anything. I asked them that i can provide all documents to proof that i am a reputable hosting provider and hosted lots of reputable business websites so please don't treat like SPAMMER. I am cPanel NOC partner since 2011 and running business since 2008 as hosting provider. But they don't care your losses and business. I called them about 50-60 time but nobody comes from abuse team only tech guys come on call and said they can’t do anything because suspended by abuse team and abuse team not responding and taking call to understand the situation. SO please beware with OVH..You will be shocked i tried suicide, because they tried finished my almost 13 years old business. They don't act like humans, they are work like Robots. ""Thats not truth, they are just hidden their fault in below response, we just got 2 report from same single IP/user in few minutes only, and even they didn't gave time to fix. I have all email conversations, If anybody want i can provide full logs, They just suspended both servers just within less then 12 hours after report. I requested lots of time for fix the issue but they didn't provide any single chance, i requested even just 5 minutes to fix the report."" Last Edited: 31/12 6:08PM IST ""Now let's leave on public what they think, I just provide my review which we suffered, because as shared hosting provider it was normal case which could be fix withing few minutes by suspending infected website OR IP address, But OVH abuse team treated like Criminal. I can not say what is enmity with us while we were ready to provide all documentation for verification. If they were humans, they could easily understand easily when we called 50-60 time within 12 hours that we are not SPAMMER, Because SPAMMER never contact again and not care for backup and downtime, but we were treated like that and middle of discussions they cancelled all services including billing panel access."""

Drawrgon,DE,"Dec 17, 2021",3,Decent if you don't need support,"First up, I've been with OVH, SYS and Kimsufi for over a decade. The support got worse every year, the offers more and more uninteresting. While they had incredible offers for several years (prob around 2011-2013), things just got more expensive and restricted. During above mentioned period, even the cheapest (4 EUR) servers at Kimsufi had a gbit connection. They're down to 100 mbit/s for years now. Support (at least in Germany, but I doubt it's better anywhere except France) is pretty much helpless and can't do much without forwarding stuff to their French colleagues. Different answers from different hotliners to the same question don't help much. Their abuse department is non-existent from my experience, even scans and attacks from within their own network are left alone. The most positive is the massive worldwide network they run, which probably failed a total of less than 30 minutes in the past decade over multiple servers. OVH IP ranges may be on blocklists of other providers, so you have to get your IP removed from their lists if you encounter issues, i.e. when sending mail. Additional IPs are cheap and can be picked geolocated in many EU countries. If the servers run, they run. No issues with traffic or hardware yet. All of their plans are unlimited bandwidth and they don't care if you saturate your connection 24/7."

If you order more than 1 server from them they refuse to align the billing dates and instead treat them like different account (so I have to keep track of multiple payment dates). Also if you are ever late they just delete your data instead of letting you pay a late fee or something. Pretty outstandingly awful support and service. NEVER USE OVH, NEVER. Incompetent, ungrateful, and useless. Edit: Taking a moment to make a comment on the out of touch response I got from OVH below.

My server kept shutting down, and I had to reinstall the OS on my server every time (It happened once I week some times) I eventually got tired of doing that and opened a support ticket. It has now been more than a week and they have not yet been able to help me. I get a response once every other day, and there is no information to help me on the response. Overall a very bad experience. This server is my only source of income, and it has set me back a couple of weeks, that I haven't been able to work for the past week because of server malfunction and a lack of support. I don't think that a hosting company like OVH can work, if their servers doesn't work 50% of the time, and the fact that you have to wait multiple weeks for help or that you have to spend hours reinstalling everything is even worse. I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere by the end of the week if this isn't fixed...

Often times they email me about the same thread that I deleted awhile ago. Not long ago, OVH took my site, my livelyhood offline until I fixed the problem (That I already fixed). It's impossible to get ANYONE from the abuse to talk to me. I even upgraded my support to a higher level (Yes you pay money for that). They basically told me Abuse team is a different department. WHO CAN I CONTACT TO HELP MY SITE SO IT DOESN'T GET TAKEN DOWN WHEN I FIX THE ISSUES? I have loved OVH for 5 years, but now am considering changing to another hosting company.

David,US,"Updated Oct 7, 2021",1,"Stay away, stay away!","Don't get fooled by how ""big and legit"" they seem. Their services are horrible. Their ""control panel"" if you can even call it that, is by far the least intuitive management system I have ever used. Their auto renewal for domains is broken so many times they don't renew and your domain gets suspended without warning (no invoice is even created so there's no way to know unless you log in and check manually). Sometimes when buying a domain, you receive an email with a confirmation of success but the domain never actually gets registered but no error messages are sent out. The worst thing is their support. No matter what my inquiry has been, their responses have been anything but on point and mostly rude and ignorant. Sometimes they choose to not even respond. I have one ticket that never gets a response while others do so it's clearly a matter of what they want to respond to and not. I've been using their services a couple of years and i've hated every minute of it. The only reason I stayed was because they had a few services that others didn't and the fact that transferring domains to someone else is costly.. If I knew beforehand how horribly bad my domains and myself would be treated by a company, I would have never signed up. Don't do the same mistake I did. Find someone else. Their sometimes cheaper domain prices are not worth the trouble.

Staffan Löwgren,SE,"Updated Sep 28, 2021",1,Don't put your stuff on autorenewal,"Never had a problem with OVH, always been happy. But what took the p*ss was when they charged me for an invoice that was over a year old on an old server that no longer exists. Get hold of the support and I request a refund. Best they can do is give me some account credits. Thanks a lot, like I need fake money sitting on my account and getting dusty for no reason. Rather than getting my money back that I deserve. Something to keep in mind, never keep your server stuff on autorenewal, because years later if you add your PayPal back to your account, you get charged for something that doesn't exist with no refund possibility. Best part it happened on my birthday as well, so happy birthday to my sorry ass. Complete theft if you ask me. Never going to back again after this, was looking into cloud options but had to add a verified payment option to do so, only reason I added my PayPal back at the first place. Edit: As the answer states below which I complete agree with, but somehow OVH hasn't heard about a partial refund."
Aseef,US,"Updated Sep 29, 2021",4,"There is a reason OVH is rated 2 stars, but...","Short summary: I can definitely see where OVH's 2-star rating is coming from. There is a reason for that. - There software / website is full of bugs. - They rarely offer any refund. - ""Meh""/Below-average support at best. - Their site loads pretty slowly. - Their VPS clock speed is mediocre at best. But I also think there are reasons for why its still worth purchasing from OVH despite such a bad rep: - Free DDOS protection: these days, all websites or game servers need some sort of protection - Upgrade Customization: With other services, if you want say an extra 4 gigs of ram, you have to upgrade the entire VPS and have pay for things you don't need (ei more storage, cpu, etc). With OVH, you need more ram? You just pay for the ram. You need more storage? You just pay for the storage. - Backups & Snapshots: Really nice feature to have to be able to restore your VPS to a snapshot before you screwed stuff up. Its not free though... - GOOD PRICING. Really the biggest reason. Not only do you get a good amount of ram/storage/memory for what you pay, but we also have the added DDOS protection in the mix. Really hard to beat. A longer explanation of why I rated 4-stars & my experience: In my case, I was trying to purchase a VPS from OVH. But during my initial purchase, after I clicked the ""pay"" or ""purchase"" button, the website told me that an ""error"" occurred and nothing happened. So of course, thinking that my purchase didn't go through, I refreshed the page and tried the whole thing again and it worked. However, as it turned out, the first purchase also went through. Next of course, I contact customer support about what had happened asking for a refund on the other VPS. But they told me that they can't do the refund and can instead ""proceed with a time transfer to the server [I] want to keep"". Sure. In my case, I was OK with it. But OVH's reluctantness to offer the cash refund definitely left a bad task in my mouth. It was a fault in THEIR software that I accidentally ended up purchasing 2 VPS'. And now they tell me to do a time transfer instead of a refund? Really unprofessional. Even if they did refunded me, the money would have ended up in OVH's account anyway, so I don't understand why they didn't just refund. But, I suppose as long as you don't have to deal directly with OVH, you are probably good. Anyhow, then, even with the cancellation of my VPS, their website still gave my error messages in the process and the VPS wasn't properly deleted. Really showed two in a row how buggy the OVH site is. Now it's been almost 2 days and I'm still waiting on a response from OVH regarding this time transfer. The first time they did respond within 24 hours though. (Edit: I did get a reply before the 48 hr marker. So not super fast- yet acceptable.) Ugh, and not to mention how long everything on their site takes to load. It's really annoying. Still, at the end of the day, despite how OVH treated me, I am still pretty happy with my package for $11.50 / month for 80 GB SSD, 4 gigs memory, and 2 CPU. And I don't have to worry about masking my IP behind Cloudflare because OVH comes with DDOS protection :). And though I didn't have too much fun dealing with support, as crappy as it was, it still got the work done. All things considered, I'm between 3 stars / 4 stars, but I definitely think that OVH at least deserves more than 2 stars, so I'm gonna go with a 4/5. Some advice to OVH for fixing their stars: - Open up the pocketbook: Stop being so reluctant with refunds. Makes you guys look cheap and greedy. - Fix your website. And improve usability. - Invest more resources into hiring better support teams."
Philip,DE,"Updated Oct 25, 2021",1,"The service breaks down regularly, support is not helpful","The service breaks down regularly. The support is extremly slow to answer and if they eventually do answer, it's often arrogant and borderline rude. They even claim that when they do not provide the service we're paying for, they don't have to refund us. In Reply to the response from OVH: This is what the support wrote us: ""There's no refund that a customer can claim for a Load Balancer problems, cause this is not an option with SLA on it."" This is another original reply from the customer support: ""It's all your decision to buy another IP LB instead of wait for resolution."" So they say that it's ok if the service is not available and the suggested remedy is to buy another service, which is very likely to fail again soon (as it did the past times). And if a (managed!) service fails, they think it's okay to wait 36 hours with a first response (and claim here that 36 hours is within the service level of 24 hours) and that they neither guarantee availability nor provide compensation if it fails. This is just rediculous. We're paying about 1200 € per month for this ""service"". Edit 2021-10-05: Still we don't have a response on this incident. The last response from the support is from 2021-09-24 (and even that is just a ""we'll contact our Kubernetes team"", since then, we have asked for an update a few times. @Luigi B.: You said here publicly, that you are responding within 24 hours. We can prove you wrong. Edit 2021-10-25: Still no reasonable response.

Mike Juretzky,GB,"Updated Sep 22, 2021",1,OVH Stop Making Money From Spam!,"Only a SPAM Organisation would leave no other way of reporting SPAM from their network, than to post a review. This is what happens: 1. Much time is spent compiling a SPAM REPORT (one of many to this SPAM LOVING COMPANY) with all the details they need to put a STOP to the SPAMMER. 2. The SPAM REPORT gets sent to their abuse email address which is: abuse(at)ovh.net. Notice they keep THEIR SPAM segregated on ovh.net away from their business which is: ovh.com. 3. An auto generated response then immediately returns (with a report UUID and in this case is: 805d8d7b-bec0-43a0-91cb-8c3eafb8a1f8, even though below they make it clear that the information provided in insufficient) saying: ================================= ""The information provided does not allow us to identify the customer or service corresponding to your report. Thus, we advise you to fulfill the following abuse form to be able to take the required measures on : www(dot)ovh(dot)com/abuse =================================== This is absolute lies, as all the information they require is on the initial report sent to them. This is their first tactic in trying to wear you down and testing your resolve in reporting the SPAM to them and GETTING THEM TO STOP THE ABUSE. 4. So, you have to click the link: www(dot)ovh(dot)com/abuse and low and behold you get to a page titled: ""Report of abuse and illegal content"". But all you see when you get to this page is an hour glass that goes round and round and round... 5. So you then search for a support address, with no luck because the only way you are going to get to REPORT THIS SPAM is to signup for an account with this SPAM LOVING company...what are you crazy! Getting back to the auto generated email mentioned above, OVH tries to wriggle out of their responsibility for the SPAM that is generated by THEIR NETWORK by saying this, ""It is important to note that most of our services are rented ""unmanaged"" to our customers. This means that we only have access to the power supply of the server. We can only maintain the hardware of the infrastructure and we are prevented from being able to access to its content (no root, administrator, or user access)."" LISTEN TO ME OVH, I DON'T CARE THAT YOUR SERVICES ARE UNMANAGED! It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to deal with YOUR SPAM, so just flip the switch to ""OFF"" and that solves the problem. But no, that means you loose YOUR SPAM GENERATED INCOME! You simply would prefer me to continue to waste my time reporting SPAM to your lousy SPAM LOVING COMPANY! OVH, GO CLEAN UP YOUR DIRTY LITTLE ACT! My update to OVH Comment They Just Posted In Last hour - 22/09/21 No, No, No OVH...you are not going to dismiss what I have said here. The url I posted above is the url that is given in the ridiculous auto generated email received from OHV. Remember the one that is sent to innocent receivers of your COMPANIES SPAM. Also, If you knew your subject better, you would know that ovh(dot)com(slash)abuse(slash) diverts to ovh(dot)com(slash)abuse(slash)#!(slash), so I followed the email from OVH exactly. So, don't try to make out that there was some sort of error on my behalf in reporting YOUR SPAM (A SECOND TIME AS WELL!), as there wasn't. Also, I don't need to test it, as I already tested it many times yesterday. Again you are just trying to wear me down (you won't I can assure you of that). Your company makes it purposely hard to report SPAM FROM YOUR NETWORK as I clearly detailed above, because that lightens the load for its people, as they don't need to do anything, as most folks just get worn down by the tactics your company employs in trying to minimize the number of complaints your company has to deal with. Also, for your information I used 3 browsers, FF, Chrome and Opera, none of them worked. I even took a video of it because I knew OVH would come out with any garbage to try to take the heat off them. So, again stop looking for excuses and ways you might try and wriggle out of YOUR COMPANY'S RESPONSIBILITY. It is nothing but lies. Why do you think 76% of the reviews here on Trust Pilot about OVH are 1 star and OVH is rated as ""Poor"". I suppose you are going to try to tell us, everyone else is wrong, right! I gave you the Report UUID, so go process it and SHUT THAT SPAMMER DOWN!

Over the years, they have apparently missed the technology train completely, with a customer dashboard that is unusable: you can hardly order a service, changing or resigning from a service is impossible. So you are at the will of their customer support, which is the most horrible in France (I can assure you, that is really bad): extremely slow, they never know who you are (not linked in the system), so before you get any answer, you are 3-5 days further. I have stayed with them, even through all the disasters they had (5 days without internet because they had an incident in Strassbourg, 4 days for another incident). They never apologised, they never reimbursed one penny and they never gave support. Everyone else has moved on, and they cannot offer quality services anymore. Stay away! Added 7/9/2021 after reply OVH Thank you for your answer. My detailed answer has been given: it remains a mystery why you separate the client ID used in invoicing/management from the possibility to resign. Secondly, it didn't work either via the other account (the standard OVH ""error"" message, I guess preprogrammed for every possible action in the OVH dashboard). Thirdly, it is strange you don't seem to know that your suggestion to upload something is complete bullocks, as that is not possible in your ticketing center (indeed, very hard to understand in 2021!!!!!).

Apostolis Bekiaris,GR,"Updated Aug 29, 2021",1,I bought my first dedicated server and…,"I bought my first dedicated server and use it with no issues, proving all the documents to authenticate myself. It was a fast process. I tried to buy a server in their cloud just 1 week later, they asked me again authentication documents and the process took a while. Clearly I got the idea that their support line is totally unstructured. After 1 month on June 28 I bouthg a 2nd server and guess what they ask me to authenticate once more locking the order and not replying to my mails. I call them on phone 3 times. They phone support mark me as priority but they site they do not have direct communication with other parts of the company. OMG what a mess they close my tickets without replaying they lock my funds they won't release the order I pay resulting in me losing money since I couldn't work. Finally after 1.5 months someone reply to once of my mails asking sorry. Sorry does not pay back my time and my losses. I asked them to cancel my account many times since then but guess what. They still sending me mails for pay. Good for me I have linked my paypal and not my credit card, so I just remove them from paypal and block their mails. JUST STAY AWAY. --- Update after their reply ---- You already harm my business and you ask me more time to what exactly? help you become better? apparently consuming more of my resources? Sure, but you have to pay me for it. Let me know...."
Kalle,FI,"Aug 12, 2021",1,Terrible,"I have used OVH since 2014, everything was fine then, but now customer support is AWFUL. They just try to avoid the problem and the ticket is closed before you can answer it. If you want to talk about the issue again, you need to make another ticket. They don't answer anything about the problem plus it's really hard to contact them. I don't get reminders about invoices and my domain was closed several times because of this. Customer support says that emails have been sent, even though their own system says that they haven't sent any reminders. If I could there wouldn't be any stars for them. I need to change the service asap."

Leslie Rein,US,"Aug 3, 2021",1,Just when I thought,"I’d experienced bad customer service in my long career dealing with service providers of all sorts along came OVH. They set a new standard. I was only using them as a registrar for a TLD I couldn’t find elsewhere. When renewal came around they started charging me VAT, which they hadn’t when I first subscribed. When I asked why they didn’t respond, so I didn’t pay. Then I wanted to move to another registrar. They wouldn’t release my domain until we went through a protracted exchange where they demanded to see originals of my personal ID and my company’s ID via insecure email, yet they have no mechanism to securely upload files on their site. Mind you they didn’t ask for these documents when I registered my domain with them. I finally solved the problem by uploading the files on one of my servers for them to look at only for them to respond that they couldn’t release my domain after all until I recover it for almost 5 times what it would have cost to renew! Now I have to wait for it to expire and then quickly register it with another registrar before they grab it and hold it for ransom. If I had the time and money I would sue them! I would give -stars if they were available."

mr. Key,TH,"Jul 25, 2021",1,Worst experience for 20 years,"Very slow account control panel. After clicking on the link, you can wait 30-40 seconds until the page you need opens. There are no links in the control panel other than ""Pay money"" and ""Restart server"". All other links to the control panel should be searched in e-mail. If you have lost access to email, then account recovery is impossible. I tried to solve the problem through tech support. But when I click the ""Recover password"" link, nothing happens. The account control panel, in my opinion, was created by schoolchildren who do not know what UI/UX are. After paying for the server, I spent two hours trying to figure out where the control panel is located in my account, but I didn't understand until I wrote to technical support. I have 20 years experience web-building. When you receive answers to tickets, get ready for the fact that there are no links in the letter to the ticket, and in order to get into the ticket zone, you need to look for a username and password in your mail. I wrote two tickets with a difference of 18 hours between them. Looking by the numbering, over 2,000 tickets were sent by other users of this hosting in 18 hours. I paid for a server in Singapore, but instead they set up a server in Canada. When I asked for a refund because I didn't need a server in Canada, they said they saw no reason to return the money."
Charles Smith,SE,"Updated Jul 24, 2021",1,Just the worst customer service EVER,"I wouldn't normally bother writing reviews here, but I felt I had to in this case because I'm just so mad. Signed up to OVH public cloud to test things out - was considering getting a private cloud, but definitely not anymore. Created a cloud instance - ordered some additional IPs, paid upfront for everything. Started getting the instance set up - spent maybe 3 hours on it, went to bed. Next day - instance totally inaccessible - no response to ping, can't access via SSH or even VNC. Turns out that their automatic backup process somehow managed to crash things... but what do I know... I created a ticket 18 days ago. I've been told ""we're looking into it"". No other information - only get a reply when I actually ask for an update. Just this minute got an automated reply saying ""we now consider the issue resolved"". Hundreds of bucks thrown at this and I got 3 hours of use out of it and customer support which couldn't give a damn about me. Can't get any decent support from anyone, no-one seems to care. Literally the worst example of customer support I've *EVER* experienced in my life. If I treated my own customers like this I'd be out of business in about a week and I'd deserve it. I have no problem with a company charging extra for premium support - I don't need my hand held but if a service I'm paying for is completely inaccessible then I'm entirely at their mercy. It's absolutely astonishing that this company can honestly expect people to serve their own business critical services from here and not even offer even the faintest notion of help. Edit to reply to OVH's reply: The ticket ID is 2566751. I have had two auto-updated since writing this... ""We consider this issue now resolved""... Erm, no? 25 days my cloud instance is unreachable and the best I can get is ""we're working on it but have no ETA"". Just shocking."

Wanted to get a basic cloud server where I could backup my local server settings just incase something happened. Setup took a little longer than other providers, but was still in good time & the service started up great. A few days in I started to get messages saying an attack had been detected & my server was going through a process of protection (what I assumed) which I thought was a good thing. This however is where the greatness stopped, I kept getting messages stating attacks were being detected, then suddenly a message stating my server had been sending attacks & the account has been closed due to breach of contract. I contacted support via Social Media & email several times, eventually someone came back to me basically stating exactly what the email said & didn't give a lot of help. I emailed back stating I reject the outcome & want more info, baring in mind this was also connected via VPN to my network if something was up then I wanted to know. Absolutely nothing came back from the support team, still awaiting their response now. I've since switched to another provided & their support team responded to a basic query within an hour.

There's no handholding and some default configs are busted, but if you have the technical knowledge to set your stuff up, then this platform is doing a really, really, really great job. Pros: * Free backup storage with a dedicated server (500 GB is more than enough for me) * 1 GBPS Connection * Fairly good documentation * Free KVM Cons: * Support is super slow * Haven't tested TCP yet, but with UDP, the firewall is only monitoring and not filtering much traffic * The OVH firewall needs about 2 minutes to fully apply rule changes. In our case, we need to dynamically open and close ports. This does cause us some minor downtime every now and then, but overall totally acceptable. I think that OVH is a good provider if you know what you're doing."

I was charge and within 1 day requested cancelation and refund because I no longer used that VPS. It took them 3 weeks to even reply to that ticket, and 1 week into that ticket I submitted a refund request through paypal directly. Paypal sided with me and refunded me. 3 weeks later OVH finally responds to the ticket stating that they cannot give me any refund, and instead would give me account credit. That wasn't good for me because I no longer intend to use OVH platform. They now keep stating I have a debt in my account and I must pay it, and I have told them countless numbers of time to close my account and that I was not paying back a debt I should not owe.

Angelo,CA,"Apr 21, 2021",1,"Violates trust, but otherwise good value in servers","I have two dedicated server and five VPSs, and have been with OVH for four years, paying them $250 per month. I don't expect great support for a $5 VPS, but for a $120/month dedicated server I do! The value of the servers is good, but as others say, their support is all show and no go. I had no problems until recently. I filed a support ticket in November 2020 about an unresponsive server. The server came back on-line many hours later, but I never heard a word from OVH. In March 2021 (four months later) they closed the ticket without ever responding. I filed another ticket eight days ago and have heard nothing. I get a billing notice at the start of each month, and April was no different, but they deleted my credit card from my account and somehow expected me to know about this. On 13 April they suspended all seven of my servers without notice, after 4 years of being a loyal customer! They sent me an e-mail to let me know the servers had been suspended, but since they host my e-mail server I only got that e-mail after the servers were back on-line. I logged-in to their dashboard and saw no notice of anything being wrong. It said the network was fine and all my servers were working normally. When I looked at invoices I saw ""unpaid"". They have automatically billed my credit card for four years. I opened the invoice and manually paid it. Then I went and checked the payment methods and saw that my credit card was gone and below the empty table was a message that said, ""If your credit card is suddenly gone, just add it back"". Judging from the message, they know they have a bug that deletes credit cards at times and are putting all the burden for that problem on their customers. Surely they could have detected that my servers were set to ""auto pay"" and that the credit card was gone and could have e-mailed or called me about it! You know it's a huge enterprise that can be that cruel to customers and still stay in business. The only good thing I can say is that they had the servers back up within an hour after the extortion payment. But there was never any human being involved. I have been gladly paying them the monthly fee; I always felt it was a good deal, and was a happy customer from 2017 to 2020, i.e., until I needed support. I filed a support ticket on the 13th telling them what happened and how they should have tried to reach me a few days before suspending services. I asked for a simple apology, an acknowledgement that they cared about me as a customer, and maybe a small credit (optional). My ticket sits there for over a week now saying ""in progress"" with no response. I have started moving my servers. This taught me: don't put all your eggs in one basket. They killed my web, e-mail, database, three DNS servers, etc., took everything off-line for hours. I'm going to spread my DNS and web over multiple services, as I've done in the past, to make sure they are accessible if one has a problem. A little more expense and hassle, but as the saying goes, ""fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me"". In short, OVH violated my trust. $250/month is a lot to my small business, but they have shown that keeping a customer they have had since 2017 does not even matter enough to call or send an e-mail when there is trouble."

Either they didn’t understand the question, didn’t bother to read it properly, or a bot replies to their support tickets with a standard reply based on certain words in your message. Their Twitter team was frustratingly useless too; first they ignored me, then they sent me round in circles. Then tech support asked for more screenshots of the same error because one wasn’t enough; they didn’t believe I was getting errors on their control panel. They also, rudely, informed me I can only cancel my domains through the website or via registered letter. They point blank refused to do it at my simple request. After two weeks of pointless communication, I wasn’t prepared to spend any more time or money on this issue, and I certainly wasn’t going to stand in line in a crowded post office mid-pandemic. So I stopped the recurring payment on the Paypal site and will patiently wait for OVH to suspend my account for non-payment as it seems to be the only way I can leave, and this after 15+ years of being a customer. In short: lousy experience and a complete shambles. Also the rudest, most unhelpful customer support I’ve ever encountered. Would not recommend."

I request a refund but they don't.

And what the customer services said is like ""we are upgrading infrastructure""??? how irresponsible. Today, I trying to use the feature so called ""nodepool"" for scaling nodes.

I tried to scale node while scaling in progress, no error, and after the current operation completed, it's ""Ready"" and stop there."

We were spending north of €250k/year so had a dedicated account manager and had few issues. During 2020 as they've revamped their support offering, there seems to be more and more misses. The latest miss has been around ordering domains. Filed the order and got an email indicating documentation was required. Neither the email or the control panel indicated what documentation was required (just an expectation for 2 documents). I filed a support ticket immediately and tried calling them. My call eventually got through their Canadian support team who historically (and still do) know nothing about the European business (good luck getting them to resolve anything). My support ticket hasn't been touched more than 24 hours later. If you are spending lots of money or can rely fully on their automation, OVH are worth considering (I've always got the impression that their technology and engineering is pretty solid). If you're looking for anything oddball / customised, go elsewhere unless you can commit a large spend."

I've currently been going back-and-forth with customer support to try to resolve an error with not being able to edit my DNS servers through the control panel.

Next, they have a notice webpage for their 2-FactorAuthentication that loads up whenever you try to go to your vps or the service you bought. When I told them about this issue they said they cannot change it. It wants you to download an APP for 2-FA or use a USB (who even uses that any more?).

Anthony Boyle,AU,"Aug 5, 2020",1,OVH Web Hosting,"OVH now offer a Web Hosting service in Australia. I signed up for the Professional plan (pro2014 web hosting plan), bought a cheap (~$5) domain (a .ovh one) to try and I quickly built my website using Wordpress. All the tools are there to quickly get a site up and running. I developed a small application to run in the background and that worked ok too. The only issue I had with it was that any emails I sent from my .ovh account went into people’s spam account. Once I was happy with my prototype, I bought a proper .com domain (from OVH) and tried to deploy that on the hosting service. That’s when I hit a brick wall. I couldn’t get rid of the .ovh domain and couldn’t deploy my ‘real’ domain. I also couldn’t get rid of the .ovh email, the system kept coming back with ‘Page not found’ type errors. I reached out to support but they were useless. They seem to only work Monday to Friday, they’re in Canada so replies only came in at night time (Australian time) and they were less than helpful. I suspect their main KPI is to get the support call out of the queue, not to actually help people. They have no concept of support or helping people or Customer Service. Their standard response is to send a link to the manual; it’s all, essentially, self-help. I asked them if I could delete the .ovh domain and the answer was “No, but here’s a link to the manual to add another domain”. I asked why I couldn’t change the email hosting and she asked if I clicked the link quickly enough and tried cutting & pasting it into my browser. Rather insulting response really. I asked if I could re-set or re-initialise the environment so I could start again and they said “No, but here’s a link to the manual on how to host multiple domains” (I already tried that 5 times). I asked for a refund so I could start again and they said “No, there’s no technical problem so we don’t do refunds”. In the end I just walked away from it. I spent around $200 but learned a valuable lesson. My advice – If you’re building a simple website and you won’t need any help, OVH are fine. If you’re an experienced infrastructure support engineer and you can manage the environment yourself, OVH are fine. If you suspect you may need some assistance then you should probably stay away from OVH and look at someone like Siteground – they are fantastic and really, really helpful."

I was skeptical about renting a dedicated server from OVH, since Trustpilot comments were mostly bad, but when you read the comments, you will see they gave a low score only because people are not experienced with managing their infrastructure, and in the free support package, you don't get support for basic things like 'How can I install PHP', etc. OVH clearly states that with free support, you are on your own. You only get support for critical situations, as I had. I was using OVH kernel for my dedicated server, and when I updated the kernel with the original CentOS one, my machine could not be booted, because OS was built with OVH kernel. They immediately send a technician to check what is wrong with the system, and they notified me right away. I contacted them, and they explained to me about the problem. What I like about them: - A modern panel where you can manage your server, access via IPMI, add more space on the fly, etc. - They respond immediately in critical situations - They are cheap - Fast internet - Support is slow, but they are very professional and explains a lot What I don't like about them: - They have good documentation, but not great, some things are missing."

I currently have a 2-CPU VPS (High Frequency) from Vultr and it performs much better than the so-called dedicated server. I have a NodeJs application running on both Vultr VPS and OVH Dedicated Server, and they were monitored for several minutes at the same time. Before long, the dedicated server's ""event loop latency"" became a large number (e.g. 17ms) while that of Vultr VPS stayed at around 5ms. I tried dedicated servers a few months ago from NameCheap and Hetzner with the same specifications, and I was very satisfied with those servers. The only reason I was trying to get a dedicated server from OVH is that NameCheap and Hetzner do not have data centers in Singapore. I had a suspicion that they had given me a VPS and labeled it as ""dedicated server"". I felt cheated."

Then if that wasn't bad enough, we got another invoice and automatic charge to our account just a few days later, for the same screw up they just fixed, !! So again we had to go through the same process of complaining and waiting - and more waiting. c) We then had a server problem which was Urgent. No one was available locally, on a Friday, so we made contact with Singapore. While the chap we spoke with was pleasant and helpful, and he communicated with us consistently and ""expedited"" our service request - 4 days later it was still ""unassigned"" and still a problem. Absolutely appalling. d) Their Billing system is a joke. Information ""unavailable"" is often seem on the screen, and there is little correlation between screen and information. Very amateurish. If you are in Australia, you can forget and Sales pr Technical support, it just does not exist, even if you want to spend money you can't find anyone to talk to. It's ludicrous.

Harry Joao,GB,"May 12, 2020",1,Absolutely rubbish!!!,"Absolutely rubbish!!!! A Spanish co-worker recommended it as the best of the best and laughed at me suggesting goDaddy. After two weeks of him trying to set up the hosting and the domain name I told him i'll just use them for the domain name but i'll do the hosting with goDaddy. A year later i get one email asking me to renew as it wasn't set up automatically but that one email went straight to my junk mail. They made zero effort in caring if i'd received the email. Fortunately i came across it just before them shutting down my website but because for some reason it takes them 1 week to process a domain name it now passed the close date even though paid before it and although they had my money and it was down to them to process the domain they completely removed my website!!!!! I then called their crappy phone service that only works mon-fri 9 to 6 where they would play football with my call passing me around from person to person including to automated messages having me to push options that had nothing to do with the solution... I still have no website they won't cancel it to free my domain and they tell me to be patient for them to process the domain!!!! Don't ever ever ever use them.... do the opposite of recommending this to anyone, warn people of how bad they are... My review is real! any review saying they are excellent is just someone in their office trying to get their score up. Oh and not to mention if you speak Spanish like i do that's good for you because some of these people can't even speak english and i had to put my Spanish to the test for them to understand me!"
Adrian,RO,"Updated May 14, 2020",2,1Gbps* unmetered connection (* 20Mbps if you use it),"I was using their latest ""NVME"" VPS... They keep sending me automated notification that I am under DDOS attacks. I am not. They automatically disable my server network around 3-4 times a day, exactly 15 minutes at a time in order to ""protect"" me. Imagine what that does to your site if it goes offline 15 minutes whenever there are most users (spike), or whenever Google bot crawls it. Google will mark the pages as ""error"" and drop them from index. I asked to receive sample IPs of these ""attacks"" but they keep telling me they don't have any (imagine that), ticket 7975797255. And that I should use tcpdump while under ""attack"" to view the IPs. Well, I did, and I seen nothing wrong. Edit: now my OVH server is unused (zero traffic), I installed Speedtest from Ookla, I ran a speedtest, I instantly got an ""Detection of an attack"" email. Because I downloaded a file with 950mbps. Next the speed was 20mbps (limited by their ""DDOS"" protection). So you get 1Gbps unmetered connection, as long as you don't use it !!! OVH charged me twice for same server 14 days ago, I still didn't get my refund, ticket 769798425 which I see as ""closed"". I honestly wish I had nicer things to say. Get well soon."

If you want to do something, well, there is a 50% chance that it will throw 500 Internal Server Error. Support will not reply to you because they just won't. I have several Dedicated Servers rented on OVH, and now I know why setup fees are so high. They hope that you will continue the service usage because you had paid tons of money, and you don't want to switch to another hosting provider. I don't know how things are going at OVH, but I know that it is THE WORST HOSTING PROVIDER I HAD EVER USED."

I told him that ""I am not getting off this call until I speak with someone who can help"" and he re-stated and shouted back and forth with me getting nowhere.

Technical support has been reasonable from time to time. I've been a paying business user with servers and public cloud providers. I have had enough, I'm gone. OVH decided to wipe their customers bank card details, without telling them. This means that come 1st of Feb, invoices don't get paid. Now a normal provider would send daily reminder emails saying please pay invoice or it will be suspended. Not so for OVH. They decided instead of notifiying a customer, just to suspend them on day 12. Quite a shock when all the websites/infrastructure went down on the 12th of Feb. So we react, we log in, find the unpaid invoices and try to re-add card details and pay. No luck, Oh no. Try to call support, get stuck on hold for ever and ever and ever. Open a ticket in their portal, no response, you get the lovely automated acknowledgement, but no response. We are now 48 hours into an outage with our entire infrastructure is still down. Thankfully we have disaster recovery and backups. OVH billing team is a liability for business and I plead with you to run away from them and never ever never ever use them. Not to mention every single new customer of theirs I have reccomended to them, has had to endure a tedious manual verification for any new product. If OVH care at all, ticket: 7590039670"

After three tickets opened (because they close the other ones when they say they will escalate the issue to another team), we are still waiting and left without any updates, and no access to the mailbox to work on; thus we cannot even read mails from our clients. Awful. The dashboard is AWFULLY slow. Doing anything will waste HOURS of your precious time.

I'm technically savvy with more than 20 years of system administration and networking experience. If it breaks, it's probably my fault anyway. I've had a dedicated server with OVH in Canada since May 2014. Amazingly low pricing (4x-8x lower than AWS EC2 for the same specs) and wildly solid reliability. In 3 years there was one network outage that lasted 8 hours on November 2, 2015 -- the entire North American datacenter network was offline due to a dark fiber failure. Other than that outage, I cannot remember another issue. When I've had issues, the phone and email support have been good enough to surprisingly technical. I'm not sure what people expect, but as long as the hardware is running and when disks fail they get replaced quickly, I'm a happy camper.

We simply lost the server and had to recreate it on another machine 2) Some servers simply become not available from some networks - They told us that the servers are too old(but they were created in year 2016) 3) We purchased an additional disk, and a day we started to get I/O errors - They told us that we had a software problem, then that we done some misconfiguration but at the end it was their administration issue, they forgot to renew the additional dist when the server was automatically renewed. 4) All our servers started to experience very low I/O performances compared with a year ago 5) We have an independent monitoring system and every days we experience at least an outage(more or less time) of one of our 30 VPS In practice every time you have an issue they say you are at fault, but we simply suffer poor infrastructure issues.

It's not easy to write something that does not sound like a rant, but they are easily comparable to criminals even though they do offer some actual services too. Their business practices include what I have all witnessed: 1. Have no customer service (this is the rule number one), 2. Do not answer to customer complaints, ever, via any communication method, 3. Try to hoarde billing information, 4. Do all communication to paying customers in French so that customers may not understand it or it goes to spam directly, 5. Have ""bugs"" in cancelling subscriptions so cancelling doesn't really work and you will be rebilled. 6. Lie about ""due dates"" of next invoices so when you get a warning it's already too late. Then they disable cancellation option. My advice: avoid. If you already did the mistake, remove all payment information immediately as soon as you can. You can try to cancel subscriptions but it probably don't matter, you will be spammed for years."

After receiving an email regarding my Auto Renewal Annual Hosting on August 27, 2019 - I wanted OVH to grant me a refund for that because I no longer wish to user their services. OVH is charging me an annual fee for something I am not even using anymore! It has passed a week only and they are charging me a full year without a refund or even a partial refund!!! I am outraged and shocked by their response to my request. There is no reason for OVH to keep my money, this is unethical to say the least. They could charge me for a month worth if they wish to, but for a year? They're forcing me to take my website files back to OVH so I don't lose that money, that's a monopoly minded people, that's robbery. It's common human error to no be on top of everything, I forgot all about the Auto Renewal. In this case it only passed a few days until I noticed the payment on my bank account, I immediately contacted them to have it canceled."

The ticket has been unanswered for 24 hours and upon calling OVH, I'm simply stuck, unable to get through to an agent. No one picks up the phone.

The names Steven and Alex over the phone are the worst agents, hang up if you hear them, they will put you on hold for a long time or talk over you and not understand your issue.

Services (1 / 5) Service setup takes way too much time. They first couldn't recognize my payment method. Then I look at the receipt. Their validation method is manual. Seriously? 3. Account (2 / 5) For the first month, I couldn't even use OVH for my needs due to the fact that it redirected to a French website. I do not understand French, and I tried to change it, but no, it wouldn't stop. Logging in to an account is an awfully painful process. If you're on the wrong website, good job. You can't log in. How about setting up a redirect for that? Although accounts are easier to manage than all the other things, it's still not good. Overall, I had a really bad experience. I will be using an other host, even if they can't beat OVH in pricing, because other hosts usually know how to make a service usable within 10 minutes. Average score: 1.3 / 5."

SBB,CA,"May 20, 2019",1,Easily the worst large hosting provider,"Far and away the worst mainstream hosting provider I've had experience with. They are a constant, persistent source of spam, and one of the most prolific hosts of spam vertised websites, AND they consistently turn a blind eye to those issues, failing to address them in ANY way - even after receiving multiple abuse complaints. They're also responsible for the ONLY servers located in Canada that I've ever received attempted brute-force logins from - and they of course ignore abuse reports regarding that as well. In fact, their handling of network abuse is so completely inept that they are one of the few providers I regularly see spammers using for both sending their junk mail, AND hosting the sites advertised in them (often even using domain registered through OVH) - spammers avoid doing that with most providers, because it means putting all of their eggs in one basket, meaning that a single abuse complaint can shut down everything. But they're clearly not worried about that happening with OVH - and it appears that OVH doesn't give them any reason to. At the same time, a quick Google search finds numerous complaints from people who have had their accounts shut down by OVH, over a temporary compromise that allowed spam to be sent from their account. So it seems that the message is: if you're a legitimate customers hosting a poorly-secured WordPress site on OVH, and it gets compromised to send spam, then they take a hardline ""shoot first, ask questions never"" approach. But if you use their servers solely for the purpose of spamming or other criminal/malicious activity, then (as long you have enough sense to do it in a way that isn't caught by their automatic monitoring) OVH is perfectly happy to continue providing service to you - even after receiving hundreds of spam complaints. Interestingly, Canada recently amended its anti-spam laws to hold providers liable if they fail to address spamming in a reasonable timeframe. OVH seems like a PERFECT test case for that, given that they profit from knowingly facilitating spamming & other illegal/malicious activity."

Steffen,CY,"May 10, 2019",4,There are really a lot of unjustified negative reviews,"There are really a lot of negative reviews and I cannot find that this matches my experience having managed hardware for multiple of their clients over 5 years now. Are they perfect? No. They are more for technical experts, so if you have no experienced IT then this is probably not the best service for you as support is quite tightly focused on ensuring the infrastructure/hardware works 'as specified', not more. Interoperability is definitely going to be your problem. If you want more, then it costs and there are still limitations. Make of that what you will. For the clients I've represented and the companies I co-own, they've been pretty decent overall. Support is basically 9-5, but I've managed to get support out-of-hours as OVH are also in Canada. Not perfect, but definitely workable. For real emergencies you will get routed (eventually). Considering the price, I can accept that. My experience is with: Web (domains, email, Microsoft) Dedicated Servers (Servers, NAS, IP) To be honest, I cannot fault the service - it works as advertised. 4 stars instead of 5 because: Sometimes support is slow to respond to tickets opened on the portal and the bundled SCSI/MegaRAID drivers for some of their dedicated servers are unstable at high I/O. Updating the drivers is a nightmare (but possible, just about) as you lose the storage and as you are remote, it's very, very hard to change them as you lose any media to install them from."

The only emails I receive from them are to tell me when to renew my servers. They are super cheap too. You have to remember though that OVH sell unmanaged severs, thats why they're cheap. The clues in the name. If you know how to manage a server via the command line then you'll be fine. If you don't and need cpanel and GUI's then stay well clear. Its just not the service for you. Most of the reviews on here seem to be from people who don't really know what they've bought. Since writing this review I placed an order on Friday night that hadn't gone through. I called them first thing Monday morning and they dealt with my issue straight away and in a pleasant manner. My order hadn't gone through because it was my first order and my details needed to be checked for security reasons. No problems with OVH. Like others have said. If you don't really know what you are doing and need GUI's and tech support holding your hand every two minutes then OVH and not the company for you. If on the other hand you want top quality servers and the cheapest prices on the web look no further."
Niclas,AT,"Mar 1, 2019",3,Affordable hosting plans but BAD technical support,"OVH is dirt cheap. But this comes at a price: technical & customer support is INEXISTENT. If you have a solid technical background in database management, PHP, and know how to address basic technical issues, you're almost all good. If not, forget about it: sooner or later you will run into a technical issue that will have adverse & permanent effects on your website. And do not hope to get any help: average response time from OVH's support is 5 days (technical support) and up to 7 days (invoices and client support). I still have 15 of my websites hosted on OVH, because I've built a technical knowledge over time, and they're not as crucial for my business (except one) as my other website hosted on WP Engine which is quite resource intensive and requires immediate intervention in case of an issue (WP Engine's average support response time is 6 minutes).

I was advised that I had to block an IP port that was used by the software system I hosted otherwise I would be cut off. I explained the situation, but they weren't interested. I even offered to buy a hosted firewall service from them, but they said they couldn't do that! In the end they took down my server - all because of LDAP being available!! Last time I checked LDAP is a IETF registered Internet protocol! Made no difference to this lot; my server was taken down. Lost the client I was hosting and they cancelled the contract. OVH are pretty useless I'm afraid. Beware!"

I have also almost daily reported these spam emails to their abuse address and to their complaint abuse forms on their website. Sometimes they may reply that they received my complaint but nothing changed.....as I continued to receive these offensive daily multiple spam emails. I even called their 800 phone number. They have very poor customer support and continued to allow especially this same spammer to abuse my email address and allow this spammer to attempt multiple spam emails to whomever they may victimized. There is no justification for this company to allow a spammer to abuse anyone by allowing and hosting so much abusive spam. Bottom line they have very poor support !!!"

I've been using OVH for 2 years now; currently renting 15 servers from them. The quality is outstanding, all the issues we had were minor and were dealt with correctly, and the prices are really good. As for the other reviewers, please review what you pay.

Matthew Stagg,FR,"Updated Nov 9, 2018",1,Bankruptcy can't be far away,"I needed to build a small environment for a client in the US. I needed two servers, one to run PFSense and one to run xenserver. First I ordered the box to be PFSense. It said 120s to deploy but it actually took a couple of hours, but I'm used to this, the same is true when I use OVH.co.uk Next I needed to order a windows instance by the hour in order to install the OS through the KVM using a local iso. Created the project, ordered the instance. Error. Over and over again. Gave up, ordered the instance through our UK account, got it, installed PFSense. Went back to ovh.fr to order the xenserver box and a /29 for the PFSense box to nat onto it. That was Monday morning this week.The client needed the service up by 5pm GMT on Monday. at 3pm GMT ovh.fr started showing my card as declined. Went to my bank to ask them if there was a problem and they said they were seeing no attempted charges. Called ovh.fr waited 30 minutes for them to answer. Told my card was being declined. Built the environment elsewhere, delivered it 45 minutes late. Called up ovh.fr the following day to ask what had happened. After the apparently standard very very long wait (this time over an hour) they said they had had a payment system problem which had now been fixed. Believe it or not I'm actually trying to use ovh.fr instead of ovh.co.uk because I live in France. So, although this attempt was an utter blowout I decide to persist. Tuesday my order for the IPs goes through and they are delivered. By Friday my order for the second server is still in ""validation"" which I now know means manual intervention by and ""administrator."" So I ring them up to ask what's happening. After the standard one hour of my life ticking down while listening to the same ""be patient while we waste your resources"" spiel I get through to them. Apparently I need to wait until an administrator can validate the order (presumably the same administrator who put through the IP order but not the server order.) They've gone home (if they'd answered the phone in under an hour they'd have been there.) It'll be Monday. I tried, I really tried to bring the business to France. But they clearly don't want it. I cannot think of a better way to tell a customer that you don't want their business than to behave as ovh.fr does. Be warned. Beware. Be elsewhere. I specifically asked for an email address to send a complaint to. None was provided so a public forum it is.

Oliver,FR,"Aug 18, 2018",2,Dishonest practices w.r.t. voucher and slow support,"Decided to try their public cloud services using a £25 free credit voucher that they e-mailed me, following prior experience with them (VPS). Made £19.87 worth of usage. Their billing system kept trying to charge me £39.74; this happened at least 3 times before support replied 6 days after my original request. (and, I think this is only because I pestered the ovh.co.uk customer support e-mail 3 days in). I also find their billing system rather confusing as there are at least 3~4 tabs concerning billing, most presenting conflicting information. Despite the control panel saying the voucher was applicable to 'All' products, it turned out that it was restricted to the UK datacentre, and this is not what the control panel defaults to using.. After a bit of back and forth, the support team did correct the amount from £39.74 to £19.87, which I gave in and paid. That said, following this experience, it has left a sour taste in my mouth and I will probably migrate."

Provided and saved in a secure place root password is no longer working so can't get through the screen asking to run fsck manually. Rebooted in rescue mode to look around but when try to reboot back to normal it's hanging. what a piece of c**p. We got notification two hours later that it's down - what a speed! We spoke to CS in the middle of outage and they were insisting everything's looking good on their side... yeah... you sounded so dull like you were about to fall asleep on the other end of the phone in the middle of a crisis. Seriously, our core system is down and you're saying that it's going to take long time to investigate/fix then can't give any time scale??? On top of that their ACP is pretty rubbish, no one has probably ever heard about UX at OVH - in ACP left menu items not accessible to me are not distinguished and look exactly the same colour as those accessible so can't tell when things activate or not = have to click through each one to find out! - I can't reset root password from the ACP either (took the time to provide feedback but no action at all - nor update details on their own systems - look at forum.ovh.co.uk - badly implemented SSL cert) - they supposed to call back to discuss but never did)... Now I wish I didn't move my services - time to look around and pay a bit more for stability and usability because these guys are making things no properly and rather unnecessarily overcomplicated. Spining up new VPS is not instant like all others do. They should create accounts on competitors' panels and look around then simply take the best functionalities - simple as that!

Enough third party accusations without proof. Technical support will not help, as they have no authority over decisions from other dept.

I have servers with two other companies who both managed to switch it on instantly. I used ovh because they seemed to be a better deal. Hmmmm. How wrong I was. The reason its taking so long? Their ''excellent'' fraud prevention department. So excellent that they can't set up an automated email describing the 457 documents you need to supply them with in order to convince them that you are a law abiding citizen. Just the first six and last four digits of your debit card (why not just have the lot - and the csv number as well), your nic handle next to it, your passport and a bank statement showing proof of address. I could buy yellowcake with less documentation. So I sent all of the above as soon as I received their email 48 hours after paying for the service. The result? Sorry, not good enough for them. No idea why - I followed the instructions to the letter. I've requested a full refund. I will increase the rating to a full two stars should they manage to refund me tomorrow. But I have the strangest of feelings that recovering the £270 I sent them is going to be a miserable affair. Will update when I hear more news.

Oly,US,"Dec 11, 2017",5,For all the negative reviews please read...,"For all the negative reviews, most of the options OVH offers are unmanaged. Meaning they have limited to no support if you have issues, which is why it's so cheap. If you expect top quality customer service, look for a managed solution. If you have an idea on how to manage a VPS and want to save some money, they are a great option. I have used them for about 6 months with no downtime with a VPS in Canada. Their automation system works great and I have not had to contact support at all. Most of these reviews that you see complain about how long it takes to receive a response from them, again most of their options are unmanaged. TLDR; If you are able to manage a server with no help, they are good. If you are going to need help along the way, look elsewhere."
Natacha Ségala,GB,"Dec 5, 2017",1,Do sign up unless you choose to sign up for life,"Everything was fine until... I decided to switch provider. Fearing this would be the case, I emailed their customer service to check on the transfer a couple of days after it was initiated. The answer I got was extremely unhelpful and patronising. When I checked a second time, this time the transfer had been magically initiated which the customer representative confirmed without further details about timeline or apologies about their previous reply. Result: my website is down. I have emailed them again. It's a joke and a bad one too. The most ironic thing is that I kept getting automated emails reminding me to make sure to renew the services! I wish OVH were as keen to enable the transfer and update the client accordingly instead of needlessly spamming about renewing."

Laurent,GB,"Updated Oct 26, 2017",1,Awful customer service (dead silent) + Unreliable infrastructure = OVH,"I have been a user of OVH for many years now using them for hosting small websites. Until now I have never had any issues. Recently one of my websites became suddenly unreachable. I raised the issue with OVH. They promised to come back to me with a fix within 30min/1h. Amazing I thought although I already doubted they would solve it so quickly. 5 hours later no news. I gave them a call. No answer. Phone line is dead. Tried again a couple of hours and I managed to talk to someone promising an answer within 24 hours.... I spare you the next details: a couple of days later I have never managed to talk to someone, sent many emails, never heard anything from them. And my website is still down. I accept technical issues may sometimes arise. I can also accept that it might be difficult to fix them technically.

Didn't know about that. But I recommend using the Public Cloud as it is a lot more easy to use.

The rest of the time the interface has worked I also faced A LOT of bugs! But the worst part is, they really seem to scam the customers. Best example: I have created a new MX DNS record (for email) for my domain in their customer interface. This is a free service. After that I have noticed in the services tab a new paid service called “MX Plan”. But, I have NEVER gave them my permission to set up this service!

Liza Zadorina,GB,"Updated Apr 14, 2017",3,They fixed their mistake in the end,"UPDATE: After i made a review here and walked through a ticket (week long), they agreed that there's no reason to charge me for the services we were not using anymore and made a refund. But it really took me a lot of time and effort to get this confirmation. Hopefully they'll improve their customer support in Future. This hosting is weird. The services itself are okay, but when it goes to a customer support.... You'd better run from there as fast as possible. What happened to us: 1) We've purchased a dedicated server from them it was working kinda okay for a half of the year and then they started to make a Hard Reboot of our machine each month. On my questions WHY they said there are some difficulties with the hard ware and they're rebooting the server due to it. This causes us at least 2-3 hours of non working site and for a growth online business is crucial. After they didn't want to do anything about this situation and poorly responded onto tickets once per 3 days, we decided to handle the situation on our own and switch to a new machine hopefully without a bug. 2) So we did it, we've purchased a way more expansive dedicated server and canceled our old server on a due date cause we just finished the configurations. You know what? They charged us for the whole next month of using the old server even we're not having it in our possession anymore. I opened a ticket asking ""What's wrong with the billing"" and they simply answered (within 4 days): it was a due date so you've been charged for a month of usage!!! They literally charged us for the server which i can't even reach anymore it's not in our control panel or anywhere else and probably already belongs to another customer with all it's hardware errors. Would highly recommend to consider another provider."

This is clearly stated in the contract you sign when ordering a service.

I can definitely recommend OVH, if you are a new customer they may do a validation/fraud check on your info to verify that you're a legitimate person, but after that you're good to go. They didn't require it for me as all my info matched up."
Danny Kilgallon,GB,"Updated Dec 19, 2016",5,Best Server Company In The World,"I have been a customer of OVH/SoYouStart for almost 6 years now. I was absolutely amazed to see the bad reviews on here as i have had nothing but excellent support and services from them from day one. Over the years i have spoke to the support team on a regular basis and i have got to know a few of them on a first name basis and sort of built a relationship with them. I have never spoke to them and not got to the end result. On numerous occasions they have gone above and beyond to help me resolve issues that i have had. My whole organisation relies on OVH and i wouldn't want it hosted anywhere else. I think the problem is that OVH/SoYouStart is for the more advanced server admins that actually know what they are doing with regards to installing their own operating systems, networks, backups etc. Over the years OVH have made some really great improvements to their backend user control panels to make it as easy as possible for users to perform tasks such as installing new operating systems at the click of a button. At first the networking of servers can be tricky, however they have a comprehensive set of guides that should be self explanatory to any competent admin. And like with anything once you become aware of how to configure it correctly you will have no issues going forward as it is the same for all the servers. Over the 6 years i have had about 10 dedicated servers and a number of VPS servers. I have only ever had one server that has gone down on me and that was due to a faulty nic that was replaced within the hour. Apart from that i have had no downtime with OVH. I would highly recommend OVH/SoYouStart to anyone needing a server that has a good knowledge of being a server admin. The prices are exceptional and unrivalled to be honest. The comments about the non existent support is simply not true i don't think i have ever had to wait more than 5 minutes on the phone to speak to anyone before. Even out of hours support is great with the guys in France and also Australia. Overall OVH is a top quality server hosting company and i cannot recommend them highly enough. I will continue to use their services and products for as long as i run my own organisations. Thank you OVH Danny"

I have had one or two very minor problems in the 3 plus years I have been using OVH but every time it has been something minor (and usually something initially caused by myself). I have just started to host some commercial sites using one of my VPS servers and have had no problems at all with them.

Brendan Rosa,US,"Jul 29, 2016",1,Absolutely pathetic,"Now, I can surely speak for this company when it comes to downtime. Our infrastructure with OVH consists of 1 master and 570 slaves (at the time of writing this). Yep, that's right. We have a total of 571 VPS SSD 1s with them. That amounts to just shy of $2,000 in monthly costs. Okay, enough of how much we're paying them and on with their quality of service. For some time now (we've been customers on and off for just about 2 years now). At the time of writing this, I'm infuriated with this issue which has persisted since we've been with them from day one. Why we use them? The low price. Is it worth it? Absolutely not. You really get what you pay for. The issue you ask? VPSs always go down all the time, having to KVM into each of the affected ones and restart the network interfaces. Sounds tedious right? Yep, especially when it cuts into precious development time where it can take 1-4 hours to fix all the VPSs just for that day. Now, this isn't about how long it takes. It's about the down time. They will most likely not refund you for downtime as they claim on their end your VPSs are ""online"", which they're NOT. I've even emailed them with screenshots on how I go about fixing the issue to potentially help squash this issue once and for all. Their care for customers is nonexistent. Again, this issue has persisted with them for years. We've informed them of the issue countless times throughout, and they seem to refuse to fix something that would keep us customers for life. Oh, and when they know it's on them, they ignore any tickets you send them. Like no response. Zero. Nada. As a customer for 2 years, I can confidently tell you they are a shady company.

Hello All, This is the worst company I've ever worked with! don't be fooled by their price, they are not worth a penny! I have Two dedicated server with them.In my dedicated servers there were some VPS and they were compromised for some time. We tried to understand what was going on and decided to hire a Security company in the US to fix the issue. They did fixed it and told us the VPS was hacked. 2 days later OVH Terminated out server and not even responding what the are steps to additionally to be taken to get services recovered. Even i tried reaching company CEO through LinkedIn ( As he is my network ) Anyway so their customer support decided to block all the access.we couldn't do anything anymore. When you have their support team on the phone it gets even worst, the only thing they are willing to do is referring you to their ''online manual'' .While they are actually capable of fixing the issue they just made, instead they asked us to go through long and complicated processes to retrive files from the ftp (files which after 5 calls to them, apparently never existed!). After being missed informed so many times we tried to talk to a supervisor, they wouldn't even let you! (I've never seen such a bad customer service in my entire career!) Here is a good tip: NEVER deal with that company EVER! and dont trust CEO ,I have no clue how he becaome a CEO I requested every one including CEO OVH to forward this message to the people in your network so they will have a peace of mind in life. Regards Medhacloud"
SG,NL,"Updated Jul 11, 2016",4,"Great value, stable servers but bad support","Stable servers, not very expensive. Support is horrible, wont respond or takes weeks to respond. Calling makes no sense, they just say i'll have to wait for response on my ticket. At the end it will be solved, but it takes a long time. Firewall also sucks, when u host a gameserver with about ~200 players on different IP's, Mitigation will automatically switch on, wich makes connecting almost impossible. No support to fix this, they are ignoring my issue for already 4 weeks."
DanaWKIle,GB,"Jun 10, 2016",1,If something goes wrong you are DOOMED,"I have been with OVH for about 8 years. Everything was fine in the beginning but in the past year the support has become incredibly low quality. If something outside your control goes wrong you are basically left alone to solve the issue. When they reply to your support request (usually after days after the ticket has been open) all they do is link to their guides online, without making an actual effort to help you. Terrible experience and I will be switching soon all my websites to another hosting provider."

christian,DK,"May 6, 2016",4,Know what you actually want and its good to go,Alot of those 1 star reviews are just people crying about the customer support. Yes the customer support is bad but their product range is huge and you can get some very powerfull machines for an solid price. If you know what exactly you want you should go with ovh/ soyoustart. As long as you can handle things yourself without needing the support for some dumb questions its a very great experience. The ddos protection is amazingly good and the specs of the machines can be very powerfull that alot other companies never will have enough resources to provide their customers with.

I have lost many many emails, I will never know the number. Some of my clients complained they could not reach me, I thought it was my mistake. But after a year of these complaints (most of the client just gave up and did not report it), I ran some automatic test to see if OVH was responsible. It regularly lost up to 80% of the email (they were not stuck in the spam, they simply never arrived). And those who were not deleted arrived 24 hours later (they were sent on a Sunday…). And it was not all: the redirection OVH was supposed to do did not even work. One email Stokes as a redirection lost even more email… OVH never responded to that, like nothing happened. By using this company you will never be sure to receive your email, and if something get wrong with them, they don’t care (it’s a French company…)"

Then later I get an email from support asking me to provide ID documentation and prof of address. I lost my patience with them at this point and emailed back and asked them to cancel my order and refund the purchase. I hear nothing back for 24 hours. Then I receive yet another email asking for ID documentation and also company registration documents. I email back and ask them to cancel my order once again. No reply.

A day later, I get an email saying that I am basically on my own, they boot the server in rescue mode and tell me to figure out how to repair my own server. Plus, the links they provide to help me fix it, I either don't have access or I get a 404 error saying the links don't exist.

Mark H,GB,"Jan 18, 2016",1,Took money and refused to set up VPS,"I saw the cheap VPS SSD 1 package and thought it would be perfect for a quick test server - a friend even recommended them. Boy, was I wrong! It said that card payment results in immediate server setup, so I went with that option. My card payment went through... then nothing. I had to wait 30 minutes or so before I got an e-mail saying my order had been created and I can make payment by clicking a link. This rang alarm bells - they'd already taken payment! Upon clicking the link, I got a copy of my order. At the bottom, a spinning icon suggested that payment details would have to be processed manually. It would seem the e-mail received was just worded poorly - something they should address. However, this morning I get an e-mail stating they received my payment but want to verify the bill payment address (same as the account address) and need me to send copies of my passport or driver's licence! I told them there was no way I would be supplying personal documentation via an insecure method such as e-mail, plus I have no idea what they will do with my identity. I provided them a .com domain I've owned since 2001 - a WHOIS will verify that the details match those I provided and always have. Since 2013, ICANN have required domain contact details be verified - an mine have been. The reply merely restated that they need photographic ID. There is absolutely no reason for them to require photographic ID, as I am not there in person to make the order. So I called them. The agent was very pleasant and understanding, but stood firm on company policy. He stated that there is a lot of card fraud and it is unlikely that anyone would steal a card and ID at the same time. Absolute rubbish! Many people carry their driver's licence in their wallet (I can attest to this having worked in a place that required photo ID - many people took out their wallets) and, if you're on holiday, your passport is likely to be near your wallet, too. As they would not budge, I cancelled my order - which they were happy to do, and hope to receive a refund soon. During the sign-up process, I did not see anything that mentioned the possibility of requiring photo ID and my friend, who has been a customer for years, has never been asked to provide any. Their T&C make no mention of the possibility of photo ID being required, either. Both their website and T&C are full of spelling mistakes, which looks quite unprofessional."

C'mon, ""Incident Line"" and you tell me there's no technician available? You even let me open a ticket? I CALLED to prevent opening a ticket, because you NEVER answer these tickets.

Anders Stark,SE,"Dec 12, 2015",5,Cheap and great,"Not sure why people are so unhappy with OVH. I signed up for their cheapest VPS plan (which by the way costs less than half a latte each month). 10 GB HDD, 1 GB RAM and 10 TB monthly transfer is included, which is totally awesome for the price. The VPS has been running a couple of months now and so far I've had no problems, I do use quite a bit of bandwidth and CPU. Sure, the OVH website is a bit unstructured and the admin panel is pretty bad, but once it's up then you can just forget about it."

Despite raising this within days of the server being provisioned they have refused to give me a refund. I proved that my server only had 90% availability and they still refused. Apparently VPS's don't fall within Distance Selling or indeed any regulations. Avoid OVH at all cost and instead go with a company that offers money back guarantee's. They are a cowboy operation! I will be reporting my experience to Trading Standards and claiming the money back from my credit card company.
Mark,MT,"Updated Jun 1, 2016",1,the worst in the world for customer support,"I have a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with them, paying around 900 eur/month, so it's supposed I should have a very good service and support. Also, I paid for the ""VIP Support"" that should grant you a ""priority"" response. Wonderful... now, how the things really works in real life ? Simple ... I submit a ticket, and nobody replies... I submit an ""incident"" ticket, and nobody replies too. Today for example I have three opened tickets, waiting since 8 days now, still with no response at all. If you look at their support page (from ovh homepage go to support and then to ""VIP Support"") you should know that: - The ""level 1 incident telephone 24/7"" ... does not exists !! When you buy the VIP support, they barely know which number to give you. If you insist with them, they end giving you a disconnected phone line (!!!!!). The only ""phone"" support they give you, even for VIP, is a ""ticket submitter service"" by means that there's a stranger operator who gently asks you what you want him to write in your ticket... and the trip starts from the beginning !! - The ""urgent intervention start <15 minutes"" and ""administrator contacts me by mail/telephone"" DOES NOT EXISTS: they removed that service !!! However, they still show it to attract more customers. Now, this is what to expect from OVH: NO SUPPORT AT ALL. If you're lucky, maybe the servers will go running for years and you'll have no problem at all. But pray not to ever need a support even for just 1 minute in your life of any kind from them: in case something does not work... it's just your problem !!. === update of 01 June 2016 === Things seems not to be changed at all since I wrote this review. The support is still far away from being just ""acceptable"". For a ""real example"" please read on: I had a problem two days ago with a host of my dedicated cloud. So I asked a replacement. My message to PRIORITY SUPPORT was like this one: ""I am having problems with host IP x.x.x.x.x - I moved it out from the cloud. I migrated all the VM's to other hosts. Could you please replace it ?"" Answer from OVH: ""Please provide us with the IP of the host you want to replace"". So ... either OVH is not paying glasses to their employees, or they have some mental problems of understanding a very simple message. By the way, my answer was: ""The host I'm having problems with is host with IP x.x.x.x - I'm waiting for the replacement"". Now the ticket is there now from TWO DAYS. No answer. Maybe the guy at the support has some problem finding the mouse button in order to do a CLICK and allocate me a new host ? Now, THIS IS the kind of support you need to expect from OVH. You are a company, you expect to buy a professional service AND a professional support. ?? No !! You just obtain a good infrastructure BUT with the worst support EVER exeperienced in your life. Customers are the very last priorities for them and are totally WORTHLESS for them. I pray EVERY DAY that the servers are still there up & running and haven't been deleted by mistake or similar. I really don't understand WHY they don't take some action to correct this lack. It's a real mistery."
iltizio,IT,"Aug 24, 2015",1,OVH are thieves,"There are some bad experience with ovh: Some month ago I bought a dedicated server on So You Start (OVH) with xenserver. I work for a lot of month with them, but the last day, only a few days after paying the month, the OVH system detects a small ddos attack (1 mbps) start from my server, probably from a windows VM, and OVH block immediatly the server. I tried to explain that no one caused the attack and the VM was new and with antivirus. Nothing. I lost the money for the new month, for the IP of failover and also the work of these months that means that I have basically wasted money also in previous months. Other thing: the last month, always with the same server, I received a ddos attack from outside and xenserver has rebooted. And the super ddos protection? The OVH system merely send me an email saying that there was an attack ddos and that has been blocked. I asked from ticket why the ddos protection has not done its job and my server is however restarted forcing shutdown of the VM. The support team asked me to send an email to an internal group, but I never received an answer. Well presented with good products at low cost and many services, but they are criminals. Once you have paid do not care about you and try to steal more money."
James,GB,"Aug 10, 2015",1,Worst Host In The World,"I bought an £11 a month VPS from them. After multiple attempts I couldn't even login to the VPS. It wasn't setup properly.

I complied but still asked for a refund and eventually he ""requested the refund to my debit card"" (still waiting for refund).

I called the 24 hour number for OVH and was told that the order would not be processed until Monday morning and that I would have to wait until then. I asked the OVH representative to cancel the order as I need the server now and not on Monday morning and he said he was not able to do that and that I should call back Monday. I emailed customer services after getting off the phone stating clearly that if they could not have the server up and running within 24 hours then it was of no use to me and that they should cancel the order. On Monday morning I received email notification stating that my order had been processed, 2 hours later I received an email from OVH stating that they don’t do refunds as per company policy. Having sent a number of emails to OVH about this issue they insist that I am not protected by consumer rights laws and that I should just use the VPS. They consistently refuse to cancel this order despite the fact that they did not set the VPS up upon payment from me and despite the fact that I requested the cancellation within an hour or submitting the order. I advised the company that I would have to do a chargeback with my bank as the service was not provided when required and I was sent the following:- ""well, there is nothing else we can do for you.
