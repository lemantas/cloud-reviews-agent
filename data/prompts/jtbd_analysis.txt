{reviews}

# INSTRUCTIONS
## JTBD Analysis Framework: identify the PRIMARY job customers are trying to accomplish by choosing this hosting provider. \
Think beyond surface features - focus on the deeper progress customers seek to make in their situation.

## Key Questions to Answer:
- **Functional Job**: What core task are customers trying to complete? (e.g., "Deploy applications reliably", "Scale infrastructure on-demand")
- **Situational Context**: What triggers the need for this job? What circumstances make this job important now?
- **Emotional Motivation**: What feelings drive this need? (confidence, peace of mind, professional success)
- **Success Criteria**: How do customers measure if the job is done well? What outcomes indicate progress?
- **Pain Points**: What obstacles prevent job completion? What current solutions fail them?
- **Evidence**: Which specific customer quotes best illustrate this job?

# RESTRICTIONS
- Focus on ONE primary job rather than multiple jobs. 
- Look for the job that appears most frequently and has the strongest emotional weight in the reviews.
